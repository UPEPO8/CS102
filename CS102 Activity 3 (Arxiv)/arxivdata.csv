Moreno-Ternero, Tim Pawlowski, Shlomo Weber","Theoretical Economics (econ.TH)","This paper examines the interdependence of international success and competitive balance of domestic sports competitions. More specifically, we apply the notion of the Herfindahl-Hirschman index to examine the effect of international rewards on distortion of competitive balance in domestic competitions and derive conditions under which the level of domestic competitive balance raises or falls. Our results yield interesting policy implications for the regulation of prize schemes in international competitions.","Tue, 13 Feb 2024 11:43:11 UTC (52 KB)"

Given the sport's fast-paced nature and the critical importance of precise object (e.g. ball, player) tracking for both analysis and broadcasting, super-resolution could offer significant improvements. We investigate how advanced image processing through super-resolution impacts the accuracy and reliability of object detection algorithms in processing football match footage. Our methodology involved applying state-of-the-art super-resolution techniques to a diverse set of football match videos from SoccerNet, followed by object detection using Faster R-CNN. The performance of these algorithms, both with and without super-resolution enhancement, was rigorously evaluated in terms of detection accuracy. The results indicate a marked improvement in object detection accuracy when super-resolution preprocessing is applied. The improvement of object detection through the integration of super-resolution techniques yields significant benefits, especially for low-resolution scenarios, with a notable 12\% increase in mean Average Precision (mAP) at an IoU (Intersection over Union) range of 0.50:0.95 for 320x240 size images when increasing the resolution fourfold using RLFN. As the dimensions increase, the magnitude of improvement becomes more subdued; however, a discernible improvement in the quality of detection is consistently evident. Additionally, we discuss the implications of these findings for real-time sports analytics, player tracking, and the overall viewing experience. The study contributes to the growing field of sports technology by demonstrating the practical benefits and limitations of integrating super-resolution techniques in football analytics and broadcasting.","Wed, 31 Jan 2024 20:37:35 UTC (15,332 KB)"
"4","Performance Insights-based AI-driven Football Transfer Fee Prediction","Daniil Sulimov","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","We developed an artificial intelligence approach to predict the transfer fee of a football player. This model can help clubs make better decisions about which players to buy and sell, which can lead to improved performance and increased club budgets. Having collected data on player performance, transfer fees, and other factors that might affect a player's value, we then used this data to train a machine learning model that can accurately predict a player's impact on the game. We further passed the obtained results as one of the features to the predictor of transfer fees. The model can help clubs identify players who are undervalued and who could be sold for a profit. It can also help clubs avoid overpaying for players. We believe that our model can be a valuable tool for football clubs. It can help them make better decisions about player recruitment and transfers.","Tue, 30 Jan 2024 07:16:09 UTC (555 KB)"

Lopez","Applications (stat.AP)","The existence and justification to the home advantage -- the benefit a sports team receives when playing at home -- has been studied across sport. The majority of research on this topic is limited to individual leagues in short time frames, which hinders extrapolation and a deeper understanding of possible causes. Using nearly two decades of data from the National Football League (NFL), the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and high schools from across the United States, we provide a uniform approach to understanding the home advantage in American football. Our findings suggest home advantage in declining in the NFL and the highest levels of collegiate football, but not in amateur football. This increases the possibility that characteristics of the NCAA and NFL, such as travel improvements and instant replay, have helped level the playing field.","Mon, 29 Jan 2024 18:33:22 UTC (2,494 KB)"

Notwithstanding their outstanding performance in familiar environments, these systems often falter in new situations due to overfitting during the training phase. This is especially pronounced in settings where both cooperative and competitive behaviours are present, encapsulating a dual nature of overfitting and generalisation challenges. To address this issue, we present Multi-Agent Diagnostics for Robustness via Illuminated Diversity (MADRID), a novel approach for generating diverse adversarial scenarios that expose strategic vulnerabilities in pre-trained multi-agent policies. Leveraging the concepts from open-ended learning, MADRID navigates the vast space of adversarial settings, employing a target policy's regret to gauge the vulnerabilities of these settings. We evaluate the effectiveness of MADRID on the 11vs11 version of Google Research Football, one of the most complex environments for multi-agent reinforcement learning. Specifically, we employ MADRID for generating a diverse array of adversarial settings for TiZero, the state-of-the-art approach which ""masters"" the game through 45 days of training on a large-scale distributed infrastructure. We expose key shortcomings in TiZero's tactical decision-making, underlining the crucial importance of rigorous evaluation in multi-agent systems.","Wed, 24 Jan 2024 14:02:09 UTC (3,085 KB)"
"8","Backpropagation Through Agents","Zhiyuan Li, Wenshuai Zhao, Lijun Wu, Joni Pajarinen","Multiagent Systems (cs.MA)","A fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is to learn the joint policy in an extremely large search space, which grows exponentially with the number of agents. Moreover, fully decentralized policy factorization significantly restricts the search space, which may lead to sub-optimal policies. In contrast, the auto-regressive joint policy can represent a much richer class of joint policies by factorizing the joint policy into the product of a series of conditional individual policies. While such factorization introduces the action dependency among agents explicitly in sequential execution, it does not take full advantage of the dependency during learning. In particular, the subsequent agents do not give the preceding agents feedback about their decisions. In this paper, we propose a new framework Back-Propagation Through Agents (BPTA) that directly accounts for both agents' own policy updates and the learning of their dependent counterparts. This is achieved by propagating the feedback through action chains. With the proposed framework, our Bidirectional Proximal Policy Optimisation (BPPO) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on matrix games, StarCraftII v2, Multi-agent MuJoCo, and Google Research Football demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","Tue, 23 Jan 2024 09:07:31 UTC (1,777 KB)"

Modeled on the dynamics of biological swarms, CSI enables the reasoning benefits of small-groups with the collective intelligence benefits of large-groups. In this pilot study, groups of 25 to 30 participants were asked to select players for a weekly Fantasy Football contest over an 11-week period. As a baseline, participants filled out a survey to record their player selections. As an experimental method, participants engaged in a real-time text-chat deliberation using a CSI platform called Thinkscape to collaboratively select sets of players. The results show that the real-time conversational group using CSI outperformed 66% of survey participants, demonstrating significant amplification of intelligence versus the median individual (p=0.020). The CSI method also significantly outperformed the most popular choices from the survey (the Wisdom of Crowd, p<0.001). These results suggest that CSI is an effective technology for amplifying the intelligence of groups engaged in real-time large-scale conversational deliberation and may offer a path to collective superintelligence.","Tue, 19 Dec 2023 21:46:14 UTC (512 KB)"
"12","TimeGraphs: Graph-based Temporal Reasoning","Paridhi Maheshwari, Hongyu Ren, Yanan Wang, Rok Sosic, Jure Leskovec","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Many real-world systems exhibit temporal, dynamic behaviors, which are captured as time series of complex agent interactions. To perform temporal reasoning, current methods primarily encode temporal dynamics through simple sequence-based models. However, in general these models fail to efficiently capture the full spectrum of rich dynamics in the input, since the dynamics is not uniformly distributed. In particular, relevant information might be harder to extract and computing power is wasted for processing all individual timesteps, even if they contain no significant changes or no new information. Here we propose TimeGraphs, a novel approach that characterizes dynamic interactions as a hierarchical temporal graph, diverging from traditional sequential representations. Our approach models the interactions using a compact graph-based representation, enabling adaptive reasoning across diverse time scales. Adopting a self-supervised method, TimeGraphs constructs a multi-level event hierarchy from a temporal input, which is then used to efficiently reason about the unevenly distributed dynamics. This construction process is scalable and incremental to accommodate streaming data. We evaluate TimeGraphs on multiple datasets with complex, dynamic agent interactions, including a football simulator, the Resistance game, and the MOMA human activity dataset. The results demonstrate both robustness and efficiency of TimeGraphs on a range of temporal reasoning tasks. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art performance and leads to a performance increase of up to 12.2% on event prediction and recognition tasks over current approaches. Our experiments further demonstrate a wide array of capabilities including zero-shot generalization, robustness in case of data sparsity, and adaptability to streaming data flow.","Sat, 6 Jan 2024 06:26:49 UTC (5,823 KB)"

The methodology is empirically validated through a case study in European football, employing real-world match and financial data. The paper advances the disciplines of sports analytics and financial mathematics by offering a cross-disciplinary mechanism for player valuation, and also links together two well-known econometric methods in marginal revenue product and expected present valuation.","Fri, 15 Dec 2023 22:16:25 UTC (1,248 KB)"

However, training a multi-agent reinforcement learning network is a formidable endeavor, demanding substantial computational resources to interact with diverse environmental variables, extract state representations, and acquire decision-making knowledge. The recent breakthroughs in large-scale pre-trained models ignite our curiosity: Can we uncover shared knowledge in multi-agent reinforcement learning and leverage pre-trained models to expedite training for future tasks? Addressing this issue, we present an innovative multi-task learning approach that aims to extract and harness common decision-making knowledge, like cooperation and competition, across different tasks. Our approach involves concurrent training of multiple multi-agent tasks, with each task employing independent front-end perception layers while sharing back-end decision-making layers. This effective decoupling of state representation extraction from decision-making allows for more efficient training and better transferability. To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments in two distinct environments: the StarCraft Multi-agent Challenge (SMAC) and the Google Research Football (GRF) environments. The experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the smooth transferability of the shared decision-making network to other tasks, thereby significantly reducing training costs and improving final performance. Furthermore, visualizations authenticate the presence of general multi-agent decision-making knowledge within the shared network layers, further validating the effectiveness of our approach.","Mon, 25 Dec 2023 09:46:50 UTC (31,488 KB)"

PR$^e$ addresses a key limitation of the Tournament Performance Rating (TPR) system, which is undefined for zero or perfect scores in a series of games. PR$^e$ is defined as the rating that solves an optimization problem related to scoring probability, making it applicable for any performance level. The main theorem establishes that the PR$^e$ of a player is equivalent to the TPR whenever the latter is defined. I then apply this system to historically significant win-streaks in association football, tennis, and chess. Beyond sports, PR$^e$ has broad applicability in domains where Elo ratings are used, from college rankings to the evaluation of large language models.","Wed, 20 Dec 2023 01:47:55 UTC (57 KB)"

Despite fruitful progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning, the challenge of addressing the dynamics of whether two agents should exhibit consistent behaviors is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a new approach that enables agents to learn whether their behaviors should be consistent with that of other agents by utilizing intrinsic rewards to learn the optimal policy for each agent. We begin by defining behavior consistency as the divergence in output actions between two agents when provided with the same observation. Subsequently, we introduce dynamic consistency intrinsic reward (DCIR) to stimulate agents to be aware of others' behaviors and determine whether to be consistent with them. Lastly, we devise a dynamic scale network (DSN) that provides learnable scale factors for the agent at every time step to dynamically ascertain whether to award consistent behavior and the magnitude of rewards. We evaluate DCIR in multiple environments including Multi-agent Particle, Google Research Football and StarCraft II Micromanagement, demonstrating its efficacy.","Sun, 10 Dec 2023 06:03:57 UTC (300 KB)"

Single-frame supervision has emerged as a labor-efficient way to train action localizers as it requires only one annotated frame per action. However, it often suffers from poor performance due to the lack of precise boundary annotations. To address this issue, we propose a visual analysis method that aligns similar actions and then propagates a few user-provided annotations (e.g. , boundaries, category labels) to similar actions via the generated alignments. Our method models the alignment between actions as a heaviest path problem and the annotation propagation as a quadratic optimization problem. As the automatically generated alignments may not accurately match the associated actions and could produce inaccurate localization results, we develop a storyline visualization to explain the localization results of actions and their alignments. This visualization facilitates users in correcting wrong localization results and misalignments. The corrections are then used to improve the localization results of other actions. The effectiveness of our method in improving localization performance is demonstrated through quantitative evaluation and a case study.","Fri, 8 Dec 2023 17:02:52 UTC (14,960 KB)"

Targino","Applications (stat.AP)","This paper develops a general framework for stochastic modeling of goals and other events in football (soccer) matches. The events are modelled as Cox processes (doubly stochastic Poisson processes) where the event intensities may depend on all the modeled events as well as external factors. The model has a strictly concave log-likelihood function which facilitates its fitting to observed data. Besides event times, the model describes the random lengths of stoppage times which can have a strong influence on the final score of a match. The model is illustrated on eight years of data from Campeonato Brasileiro de Futebol Série A. We find that dynamic regressors significantly improve the in-game predictive power of the model. In particular, a) when a team receives a red card, its goal intensity decreases more than 30%; b) the goal rate of a team increases by 10% if it is losing by one goal and by 20% if its losing by two goals; and c) when the goal difference at the end of the second half is less than or equal to one, the stoppage time is on average more than one minute longer than in matches with a difference of two goals.","Thu, 7 Dec 2023 14:59:04 UTC (2,153 KB)"

Efficient computation and efficacious evaluation of communities are both essential, especially in commercial and industrial settings. However, the solution space of graph partitioning increases drastically with the number of vertices and subgroups. With an eye to solving large scale graph partitioning and other optimization problems within a short period of time, the Digital Annealer (DA), a specialized CMOS hardware also featuring improved algorithms, has been devised by Fujitsu Ltd. This study gauges Fujitsu DA's performance and running times. The modularity was implemented as both the objective function and metric for the solutions. The graph partitioning problems were formatted into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) structures so that they could be adequately imported into the DA. The DA yielded the highest modularity among other studies when partitioning Karate Club, Les Miserables, American Football, and Dolphin. Moreover, the DA was able to partition the Case 1354pegase power grid network into 45 subgroups, calling for 60,930 binary variables, whilst delivering optimal modularity results within a solving time of roughly 80 seconds.

Originally, it was proposed for the ranking system of chess players, but it was soon adapted to many other zero-sum sports fields like football, baseball, basketball , etc. Nowadays, besides the traditional sports games, computer/video games are also playing an important role in social lives especially among the teenagers. In most of the online competition games, player's performance is usually scored and recorded by the game's ranking system. Meanwhile, ranking system like ladder in Dota is not the only the metric for the players to evaluate their gaming strength, an ELO rating score based on players in-game performance is also a decisive factor for gamers' matching. Namely, the matching system will refer to players' score in the ranking system and performance score system to ensure the matched players will promisingly undergo a balanced game without one team dramatically overwhelming the other. ELO scheme and its variants in modern online competition games aims to ensuring the expected winning rate for each team approaches 50\%. However, ELO rating is also causing compliments among players. In this research, I will dig into the advantages and drawbacks of leveraging ELO ranking system in online games and why it is still employed by game developers despite the fact that it is disliked by most of the players.

One potential solution to address this issue lies in the evaluation of the respective league strength. This article endeavors to compute club ratings of the first and second European and South American leagues. In order to calculate these ratings, the authors have designed the Glicko-2 rating system-based approach, which overcomes some Glicko-2 limitations.

Many relevant approaches have been proposed, utilizing direct feature based, or deep learning methodologies. In this paper, we propose a generalized RANSAC algorithm, H-RANSAC, to retrieve homography image transformations from sets of points without descriptive local feature vectors and point pairing. We allow the points to be optionally labelled in two classes. We propose a robust criterion that rejects implausible point selection before each iteration of RANSAC, based on the type of the quadrilaterals formed by random point pair selection (convex or concave and (non)-self-intersecting). A similar post-hoc criterion rejects implausible homography transformations is included at the end of each iteration. The expected maximum iterations of $H$-RANSAC are derived for different probabilities of success, according to the number of points per image and per class, and the percentage of outliers. The proposed methodology is tested on a large dataset of images acquired by 12 cameras during real football matches, where radically different views at each timestamp are to be matched. Comparisons with state-of-the-art implementations of RANSAC combined with classic and deep learning image salient point detection indicates the superiority of the proposed $H$-RANSAC, in terms of average reprojection error and number of successfully processed pairs of frames, rendering it the method of choice in cases of image homography alignment with few tens of points, while local features are not available, or not descriptive enough.

Curriculum learning is an effective way to accelerate learning, but an under-explored dimension for generating a curriculum is the difficulty-to-learn of the subgames -- games induced by starting from a specific state. In this work, we present a novel subgame curriculum learning framework for zero-sum games. It adopts an adaptive initial state distribution by resetting agents to some previously visited states where they can quickly learn to improve performance. Building upon this framework, we derive a subgame selection metric that approximates the squared distance to NE values and further adopt a particle-based state sampler for subgame generation. Integrating these techniques leads to our new algorithm, Subgame Automatic Curriculum Learning (SACL), which is a realization of the subgame curriculum learning framework. SACL can be combined with any MARL algorithm such as MAPPO. Experiments in the particle-world environment and Google Research Football environment show SACL produces much stronger policies than baselines. In the challenging hide-and-seek quadrant environment, SACL produces all four emergent stages and uses only half the samples of MAPPO with self-play.

"30","Fictitious Cross-Play: Learning Global Nash Equilibrium in Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Games","Zelai Xu, Yancheng Liang, Chao Yu, Yu Wang, Yi Wu","Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)","Self-play (SP) is a popular multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for solving competitive games, where each agent optimizes policy by treating others as part of the environment. Despite the empirical successes, the theoretical properties of SP-based methods are limited to two-player zero-sum games. However, for mixed cooperative-competitive games where agents on the same team need to cooperate with each other, we can show a simple counter-example where SP-based methods cannot converge to a global Nash equilibrium (NE) with high probability. Alternatively, Policy-Space Response Oracles (PSRO) is an iterative framework for learning NE, where the best responses w.r.t. previous policies are learned in each iteration. PSRO can be directly extended to mixed cooperative-competitive settings by jointly learning team best responses with all convergence properties unchanged. However, PSRO requires repeatedly training joint policies from scratch till convergence, which makes it hard to scale to complex games. In this work, we develop a novel algorithm, Fictitious Cross-Play (FXP), which inherits the benefits from both frameworks. FXP simultaneously trains an SP-based main policy and a counter population of best response policies. The main policy is trained by fictitious self-play and cross-play against the counter population, while the counter policies are trained as the best responses to the main policy's past versions. We validate our method in matrix games and show that FXP converges to global NEs while SP methods fail. We also conduct experiments in a gridworld domain, where FXP achieves higher Elo ratings and lower exploitabilities than baselines, and a more challenging football game, where FXP defeats SOTA models with over 94% win rate.","Thu, 5 Oct 2023 07:19:33 UTC (3,133 KB)"

Users select players for their lineup to maximize their FPTS within a set player salary cap. This paper focuses on (1) the development of a method to forecast NFL player performance under uncertainty and (2) determining an optimal lineup to maximize FPTS under a set salary limit. A supervised learning neural network was created and used to project FPTS based on past player performance (2018 NFL regular season for this work) prior to the upcoming week. These projected FPTS were used in a mixed integer linear program to find the optimal lineup. The performance of resultant lineups was compared to randomly-created lineups. On average, the optimal lineups outperformed the random lineups. The generated lineups were then compared to real-world lineups from users on DraftKings. The generated lineups generally fell in approximately the 31st percentile (median). The FPTS methods and predictions presented here can be further improved using this study as a baseline comparison.","Tue, 26 Sep 2023 20:26:32 UTC (322 KB)[v2] Thu, 28 Sep 2023 12:15:16 UTC (322 KB)"

However, the absence of standardized environment settings and unified evaluation metrics for multi-agent scenarios hampers the consistent understanding of various studies. Furthermore, the challenging 5-vs-5 and 11-vs-11 full-game scenarios have received limited thorough examination due to their substantial training complexities. To address these gaps, this paper extends the original environment by not only standardizing the environment settings and benchmarking cooperative learning algorithms across different scenarios, including the most challenging full-game scenarios, but also by discussing approaches to enhance football AI from diverse perspectives and introducing related research tools. Specifically, we provide a distributed and asynchronous population-based self-play framework with diverse pre-trained policies for faster training, two football-specific analytical tools for deeper investigation, and an online leaderboard for broader evaluation. The overall expectation of this work is to advance the study of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning on Google Research Football environment, with the ultimate goal of benefiting real-world sports beyond virtual games.","Fri, 22 Sep 2023 15:50:07 UTC (22,617 KB)"

Players' contributions to the whole match are evaluated unfairly, those who have more chances to score goals earn more credit than others, while the indirect and unnoticeable impact that comes from continuous movement has been ignored. This research presents a novel deep-learning network architecture which is capable to predict the potential end location of passes and how players' movement before the pass affects the final outcome. Once analysed more than 28,000 pass events, a robust prediction can be achieved with more than 0.7 Top-1 accuracy. And based on the prediction, a better understanding of the pitch control and pass option could be reached to measure players' off-ball movement contribution to defensive performance. Moreover, this model could provide football analysts a better tool and metric to understand how players' movement over time contributes to the game strategy and final victory.","Mon, 4 Sep 2023 11:14:22 UTC (982 KB)"

Chan","Applications (stat.AP)","For decades, National Football League (NFL) coaches' observed fourth down decisions have been largely inconsistent with prescriptions based on statistical models. In this paper, we develop a framework to explain this discrepancy using a novel inverse optimization approach. We model the fourth down decision and the subsequent sequence of plays in a game as a Markov decision process (MDP), the dynamics of which we estimate from NFL play-by-play data from the 2014 through 2022 seasons. We assume that coaches' observed decisions are optimal but that the risk preferences governing their decisions are unknown. This yields a novel inverse decision problem for which the optimality criterion, or risk measure, of the MDP is the estimand. Using the quantile function to parameterize risk, we estimate which quantile-optimal policy yields the coaches' observed decisions as minimally suboptimal. In general, we find that coaches' fourth-down behavior is consistent with optimizing low quantiles of the next-state value distribution, which corresponds to conservative risk preferences. We also find that coaches exhibit higher risk tolerances when making decisions in the opponent's half of the field than in their own, and that league average fourth down risk tolerances have increased over the seasons in our data.","Fri, 1 Sep 2023 23:06:26 UTC (2,549 KB)"

However, exploration still remains a challenging problem in MARL due to the partial observability of the agents and the exploration space that can grow exponentially as the number of agents increases. Firstly, in order to address the scalability issue of the exploration space, we define a formation-based equivalence relation on the exploration space and aim to reduce the search space by exploring only meaningful states in different formations. Then, we propose a novel formation-aware exploration (FoX) framework that encourages partially observable agents to visit the states in diverse formations by guiding them to be well aware of their current formation solely based on their own observations. Numerical results show that the proposed FoX framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art MARL algorithms on Google Research Football (GRF) and sparse Starcraft II multi-agent challenge (SMAC) tasks.","Tue, 22 Aug 2023 08:39:44 UTC (26,063 KB)[v2] Sun, 14 Jan 2024 04:46:49 UTC (21,726 KB)"

Most popular methods for rank-order data postulate a linear specification for the latent scores, which determine the observed ranks, and ignore the temporal dependence of the ranking lists. To address these issues, novel nonparametric static (ROBART) and autoregressive (ARROBART) models are introduced, with latent scores defined as nonlinear Bayesian additive regression tree functions of covariates. To make inferences in the dynamic ARROBART model, closed-form filtering, predictive, and smoothing distributions for the latent time-varying scores are derived. These results are applied in a Gibbs sampler with data augmentation for posterior inference.

This method is crafted to stabilize the significant fluctuations in intrinsic rewards in previously explored areas and promote broader exploration, effectively curbing the revisitation phenomenon.

We investigated this fundamental aspect of motor control in the setting of autonomous robotic operations. We approach this problem by hierarchical generative modelling equipped with multi-level planning-for autonomous task completion-that mimics the deep temporal architecture of human motor control. Here, temporal depth refers to the nested time scales at which successive levels of a forward or generative model unfold, for example, delivering an object requires a global plan to contextualise the fast coordination of multiple local movements of limbs. This separation of temporal scales also motivates robotics and control. Specifically, to achieve versatile sensorimotor control, it is advantageous to hierarchically structure the planning and low-level motor control of individual limbs. We use numerical and physical simulation to conduct experiments and to establish the efficacy of this formulation. Using a hierarchical generative model, we show how a humanoid robot can autonomously complete a complex task that necessitates a holistic use of locomotion, manipulation, and grasping. Specifically, we demonstrate the ability of a humanoid robot that can retrieve and transport a box, open and walk through a door to reach the destination, approach and kick a football, while showing robust performance in presence of body damage and ground irregularities. Our findings demonstrated the effectiveness of using human-inspired motor control algorithms, and our method provides a viable hierarchical architecture for the autonomous completion of challenging goal-directed tasks.","Tue, 15 Aug 2023 13:51:03 UTC (1,913 KB)"

However, current multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods primarily focus on improving individual policies and do not adequately address group-level policies, which leads to weak cooperation. To address this issue, we propose a novel Consensus-oriented Strategy (CoS) that emphasizes group and individual policies simultaneously. Specifically, CoS comprises two main components: (a) the vector quantized group consensus module, which extracts discrete latent embeddings that represent the stable and discriminative group consensus, and (b) the group consensus-oriented strategy, which integrates the group policy using a hypernet and the individual policies using the group consensus, thereby promoting coordination at both the group and individual levels. Through empirical experiments on cooperative navigation tasks with both discrete and continuous spaces, as well as Google research football, we demonstrate that CoS outperforms state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and achieves better collaboration, thus providing a promising solution for achieving effective coordination in multi-agent systems.","Fri, 28 Jul 2023 12:41:36 UTC (7,948 KB)"

Yeung, Keisuke Fujii","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Complex interactions between two opposing agents frequently occur in domains of machine learning, game theory, and other application domains. Quantitatively analyzing the strategies involved can provide an objective basis for decision-making. One such critical scenario is shot-taking in football, where decisions, such as whether the attacker should shoot or pass the ball and whether the defender should attempt to block the shot, play a crucial role in the outcome of the game. However, there are currently no effective data-driven and/or theory-based approaches to analyzing such situations. To address this issue, we proposed a novel framework to analyze such scenarios based on game theory, where we estimate the expected payoff with machine learning (ML) models, and additional features for ML models were extracted with a theory-based shot block model. Conventionally, successes or failures (1 or 0) are used as payoffs, while a success shot (goal) is extremely rare in football. Therefore, we proposed the Expected Probability of Shot On Target (xSOT) metric to evaluate players' actions even if the shot results in no goal; this allows for effective differentiation and comparison between different shots and even enables counterfactual shot situation analysis. In our experiments, we have validated the framework by comparing it with baseline and ablated models. Furthermore, we have observed a high correlation between the xSOT and existing metrics. This alignment of information suggests that xSOT provides valuable insights. Lastly, as an illustration, we studied optimal strategies in the World Cup 2022 and analyzed a shot situation in EURO 2020.","Thu, 27 Jul 2023 09:42:25 UTC (2,214 KB)"

In higher dimensions, we point out a close relationship between the extension problem and castling equivalence of prehomogeneous vector spaces.

Thanks to the Cheltsov--Rubinstein classification, this amounts to considering 10 families. In 8 families the problem has been solved by work of Cheltsov--Rubinstein, Fujita and Mazzeo--Rubinstein. The remaining 2 families are rational surfaces parameterized by the self-intersection of the 0-section $n$ and the number of blow-ups $m$. By Cheltsov--Rubinstein, Cheltsov--Rubinstein--Zhang and Fujita, Kähler--Einstein edge metrics exist when either $m=0$ or $m\geq3$ for the first family, and the cases $m=1,2$ have been studied by Fujita--Liu--Süss--Zhang--Zhuang and Fujita. The final remaining family, denoted $\mathrm{(II.6A.n.m)}$ in the Cheltsov--Rubinstein classification, is more difficult as the boundary consists of two components, unlike any of the other 9 families. It is the generalization of the football to complex surfaces with the pair $\mathrm{(II.6A.0.0)}$ being exactly the football times $\mathbb{P}^1$. The pairs $\mathrm{(II.6A.n.0)}$ have been completely understood by the work of Rubinstein--Zhang using the $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundle structure of Hirzebruch surfaces. This article studies the family $\mathrm{(II.6A.n.m)}$ for $m\geq1$. These pairs no longer have a $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundle structure and are therefore more difficult to tackle. The main result is a necessary and sufficient condition on the angles for the existence of Kähler--Einstein edge metrics, generalizing the Rubinstein--Zhang condition. Thus, we resolve the Cheltsov--Rubinstein problem for strongly asymptotically log del Pezzo surfaces.","Mon, 12 Jun 2023 17:58:43 UTC (18 KB)"

With 12,780 simulated head impacts, we performed unsupervised domain adaptation on on-field head impacts from 302 college football (CF) impacts and 457 mixed martial arts (MMA) impacts using domain regularized component analysis (DRCA) and cycle-GAN-based methods. The new model improved the MPS/MPSR estimation accuracy, with the DRCA method significantly outperforming other domain adaptation methods in prediction accuracy (p<0.001): MPS RMSE: 0.027 (CF) and 0.037 (MMA); MPSR RMSE: 7.159 (CF) and 13.022 (MMA). On another two hold-out test sets with 195 college football impacts and 260 boxing impacts, the DRCA model significantly outperformed the baseline model without domain adaptation in MPS and MPSR estimation accuracy (p<0.001). The DRCA domain adaptation reduces the MPS/MPSR estimation error to be well below TBI thresholds, enabling accurate brain deformation estimation to detect TBI in future clinical applications.","Thu, 8 Jun 2023 14:52:56 UTC (2,327 KB)"

Despite the encouraging results achieved, CTDE makes an independence assumption on agent policies, which limits agents to adopt global cooperative information from each other during centralized training. Therefore, we argue that existing CTDE methods cannot fully utilize global information for training, leading to an inefficient joint-policy exploration and even suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce a novel Centralized Advising and Decentralized Pruning (CADP) framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning, that not only enables an efficacious message exchange among agents during training but also guarantees the independent policies for execution. Firstly, CADP endows agents the explicit communication channel to seek and take advices from different agents for more centralized training. To further ensure the decentralized execution, we propose a smooth model pruning mechanism to progressively constraint the agent communication into a closed one without degradation in agent cooperation capability. Empirical evaluations on StarCraft II micromanagement and Google Research Football benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts. Our code will be made publicly available.","Sat, 27 May 2023 03:15:24 UTC (3,307 KB)"

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework to generate flexible and diverse behaviors in cyberspace; however, when modeling real-world biological multi-agents, there is a domain gap between behaviors in the source (i.e., real-world data) and the target (i.e., cyberspace for RL), and the source environment parameters are usually unknown. In this paper, we propose a method for adaptive action supervision in RL from real-world demonstrations in multi-agent scenarios. We adopt an approach that combines RL and supervised learning by selecting actions of demonstrations in RL based on the minimum distance of dynamic time warping for utilizing the information of the unknown source dynamics. This approach can be easily applied to many existing neural network architectures and provide us with an RL model balanced between reproducibility as imitation and generalization ability to obtain rewards in cyberspace. In the experiments, using chase-and-escape and football tasks with the different dynamics between the unknown source and target environments, we show that our approach achieved a balance between the reproducibility and the generalization ability compared with the baselines. In particular, we used the tracking data of professional football players as expert demonstrations in football and show successful performances despite the larger gap between behaviors in the source and target environments than the chase-and-escape task.","Mon, 22 May 2023 13:33:37 UTC (7,257 KB)[v2] Sat, 27 May 2023 01:56:14 UTC (7,257 KB)[v3] Fri, 15 Dec 2023 09:20:57 UTC (7,257 KB)[v4] Tue, 19 Dec 2023 13:29:33 UTC (7,256 KB)"
"55","Here Comes the STRAIN: Analyzing Defensive Pass Rush in American Football with Player Tracking Data","Quang Nguyen, Ronald Yurko, Gregory J. Matthews","Applications (stat.AP)","In American football, a pass rush is an attempt by the defensive team to disrupt the offense and prevent the quarterback (QB) from completing a pass. Existing metrics for assessing pass rush performance are either discrete-time quantities or based on subjective judgment. Using player tracking data, we propose STRAIN, a novel metric for evaluating pass rushers in the National Football League (NFL) at the continuous-time within-play level. Inspired by the concept of strain rate in materials science, STRAIN is a simple and interpretable means for measuring defensive pressure in football. It is a directly-observed statistic as a function of two features: the distance between the pass rusher and QB, and the rate at which this distance is being reduced. Our metric possesses great predictability of pressure and stability over time. We also fit a multilevel model for STRAIN to understand the defensive pressure contribution of every pass rusher at the play-level. We apply our approach to NFL data and present results for the first eight weeks of the 2021 regular season. In particular, we provide comparisons of STRAIN for different defensive positions and play outcomes, and rankings of the NFL's best pass rushers according to our metric.","Wed, 17 May 2023 14:52:49 UTC (113 KB)[v2] Thu, 20 Jul 2023 17:54:26 UTC (190 KB)[v3] Mon, 31 Jul 2023 01:40:24 UTC (187 KB)"

In this work, we fill the gap by providing a population-based MARL training pipeline and hyperparameter settings on multi-agent football scenario that outperforms the bot with difficulty 1.0 from scratch within 2 million steps. Our experiments serve as a reference for the expected performance of Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO), a state-of-the-art multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm where each agent tries to maximize its own policy independently across various training configurations. Meanwhile, we open-source our training framework Light-MALib which extends the MALib codebase by distributed and asynchronized implementation with additional analytical tools for football games. Finally, we provide guidance for building strong football AI with population-based training and release diverse pretrained policies for benchmarking. The goal is to provide the community with a head start for whoever experiment their works on GRF and a simple-to-use population-based training framework for further improving their agents through self-play.

Schuller","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","The MuSe 2023 is a set of shared tasks addressing three different contemporary multimodal affect and sentiment analysis problems: In the Mimicked Emotions Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Mimic), participants predict three continuous emotion targets. This sub-challenge utilises the Hume-Vidmimic dataset comprising of user-generated videos. For the Cross-Cultural Humour Detection Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Humour), an extension of the Passau Spontaneous Football Coach Humour (Passau-SFCH) dataset is provided. Participants predict the presence of spontaneous humour in a cross-cultural setting. The Personalisation Sub-Challenge (MuSe-Personalisation) is based on the Ulm-Trier Social Stress Test (Ulm-TSST) dataset, featuring recordings of subjects in a stressed situation. Here, arousal and valence signals are to be predicted, whereas parts of the test labels are made available in order to facilitate personalisation. MuSe 2023 seeks to bring together a broad audience from different research communities such as audio-visual emotion recognition, natural language processing, signal processing, and health informatics. In this baseline paper, we introduce the datasets, sub-challenges, and provided feature sets. As a competitive baseline system, a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is employed. On the respective sub-challenges' test datasets, it achieves a mean (across three continuous intensity targets) Pearson's Correlation Coefficient of .4727 for MuSe-Mimic, an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of .8310 for MuSe-Humor and Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) values of .7482 for arousal and .7827 for valence in the MuSe-Personalisation sub-challenge.","Fri, 5 May 2023 08:53:57 UTC (910 KB)"
"58","Club coefficients in the UEFA Champions League: Time for shift to an Elo-based formula","László Csató","Applications (stat.AP)","One of the most popular club football tournaments, the UEFA Champions League, will see a fundamental reform from the 2024/25 season: the traditional group stage will be replaced by one league where each of the 36 teams plays eight matches. To guarantee that the opponents of the clubs are of the same strength in the new design, it is crucial to forecast the performance of the teams before the tournament as well as possible. This paper investigates whether the currently used rating of the teams, the UEFA club coefficient, can be improved by taking the games played in the national leagues into account. According to our logistic regression models, a variant of the Elo method provides a higher accuracy in terms of explanatory power in the Champions League matches. The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) is encouraged to follow the example of the FIFA World Ranking and reform the calculation of the club coefficients in order to avoid unbalanced schedules in the novel tournament format of the Champions League.","Tue, 18 Apr 2023 15:51:13 UTC (16 KB)[v2] Wed, 10 May 2023 12:19:33 UTC (16 KB)[v3] Thu, 11 May 2023 12:55:24 UTC (16 KB)[v4] Fri, 1 Sep 2023 12:36:02 UTC (18 KB)[v5] Wed, 27 Sep 2023 15:02:37 UTC (20 KB)[v6] Tue, 31 Oct 2023 15:09:32 UTC (20 KB)"
