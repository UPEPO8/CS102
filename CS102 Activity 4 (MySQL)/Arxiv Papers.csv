1,"Efficient Episodic Memory Utilization of Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning","Hyungho Na, Yunkyeong Seo, Il-chul Moon","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), agents aim to achieve a common goal, such as defeating enemies or scoring a goal. Existing MARL algorithms are effective but still require significant learning time and often get trapped in local optima by complex tasks, subsequently failing to discover a goal-reaching policy. To address this, we introduce Efficient episodic Memory Utilization (EMU) for MARL, with two primary objectives: (a) accelerating reinforcement learning by leveraging semantically coherent memory from an episodic buffer and (b) selectively promoting desirable transitions to prevent local convergence. To achieve (a), EMU incorporates a trainable encoder/decoder structure alongside MARL, creating coherent memory embeddings that facilitate exploratory memory recall. To achieve (b), EMU introduces a novel reward structure called episodic incentive based on the desirability of states. This reward improves the TD target in Q-learning and acts as an additional incentive for desirable transitions. We provide theoretical support for the proposed incentive and demonstrate the effectiveness of EMU compared to conventional episodic control. The proposed method is evaluated in StarCraft II and Google Research Football, and empirical results indicate further performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods.","Sat, 2 Mar 2024 07:37:05 UTC (31,056 KB)"
2,"Leveraging Team Correlation for Approximating Equilibrium in Two-Team Zero-Sum Games","Naming Liu, Mingzhi Wang, Youzhi Zhang, Yaodong Yang, Bo An, Ying Wen","Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT)","Two-team zero-sum games are one of the most important paradigms in game theory. In this paper, we focus on finding an unexploitable equilibrium in large team games. An unexploitable equilibrium is a worst-case policy, where members in the opponent team cannot increase their team reward by taking any policy, e.g., cooperatively changing to other joint policies. As an optimal unexploitable equilibrium in two-team zero-sum games, correlated-team maxmin equilibrium remains unexploitable even in the worst case where players in the opponent team can achieve arbitrary cooperation through a joint team policy. However, finding such an equilibrium in large games is challenging due to the impracticality of evaluating the exponentially large number of joint policies. To solve this problem, we first introduce a general solution concept called restricted correlated-team maxmin equilibrium, which solves the problem of being impossible to evaluate all joint policy by a sample factor while avoiding an exploitation problem under the incomplete joint policy evaluation. We then develop an efficient sequential correlation mechanism, and based on which we propose an algorithm for approximating the unexploitable equilibrium in large games. We show that our approach achieves lower exploitability than the state-of-the-art baseline when encountering opponent teams with different exploitation ability in large team games including Google Research Football.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 03:40:34 UTC (13,433 KB)"

Our approach relies on generative AI models to transform a large volume of multimodal data (e.g., videos, articles, real-time scoring feeds, statistics, and fact sheets) into coherent and fluent text. Based on this approach, we introduce, for the first time, an AI commentary system, which was deployed to produce automated narrations for highlight packages at the 2023 US Open, Wimbledon, and Masters tournaments. In the same vein, our solution was extended to create personalized content for ESPN Fantasy Football and stories about music artists for the Grammy awards. These applications were built using a common software architecture achieved a 15x speed improvement with an average Rouge-L of 82.00 and perplexity of 6.6.

4,"The Geography of Information Diffusion in Online Discourse on Europe and Migration","Elisa Leonardelli, Sara Tonelli","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","The online diffusion of information related to Europe and migration has been little investigated from an external point of view. However, this is a very relevant topic, especially if users have had no direct contact with Europe and its perception depends solely on information retrieved online. In this work we analyse the information circulating online about Europe and migration after retrieving a large amount of data from social media (Twitter), to gain new insights into topics, magnitude, and dynamics of their diffusion. We combine retweets and hashtags network analysis with geolocation of users, linking thus data to geography and allowing analysis from an ""outside Europe"" perspective, with a special focus on Africa. We also introduce a novel approach based on cross-lingual quotes, i.e. when content in a language is commented and retweeted in another language, assuming these interactions are a proxy for connections between very distant communities. Results show how the majority of online discussions occurs at a national level, especially when discussing migration. Language (English) is pivotal for information to become transnational and reach far. Transnational information flow is strongly unbalanced, with content mainly produced in Europe and amplified outside. Conversely Europe-based accounts tend to be self-referential when they discuss migration-related topics. Football is the most exported topic from Europe worldwide. Moreover, important nodes in the communities discussing migration-related topics include accounts of official institutions and international agencies, together with journalists, news, commentators and activists.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 13:30:34 UTC (3,585 KB)"

Given the sport's fast-paced nature and the critical importance of precise object (e.g. ball, player) tracking for both analysis and broadcasting, super-resolution could offer significant improvements. We investigate how advanced image processing through super-resolution impacts the accuracy and reliability of object detection algorithms in processing football match footage. Our methodology involved applying state-of-the-art super-resolution techniques to a diverse set of football match videos from SoccerNet, followed by object detection using Faster R-CNN. The performance of these algorithms, both with and without super-resolution enhancement, was rigorously evaluated in terms of detection accuracy. The results indicate a marked improvement in object detection accuracy when super-resolution preprocessing is applied. The improvement of object detection through the integration of super-resolution techniques yields significant benefits, especially for low-resolution scenarios, with a notable 12\% increase in mean Average Precision (mAP) at an IoU (Intersection over Union) range of 0.50:0.95 for 320x240 size images when increasing the resolution fourfold using RLFN. As the dimensions increase, the magnitude of improvement becomes more subdued; however, a discernible improvement in the quality of detection is consistently evident. Additionally, we discuss the implications of these findings for real-time sports analytics, player tracking, and the overall viewing experience. The study contributes to the growing field of sports technology by demonstrating the practical benefits and limitations of integrating super-resolution techniques in football analytics and broadcasting.","Wed, 31 Jan 2024 20:37:35 UTC (15,332 KB)"
8,"Performance Insights-based AI-driven Football Transfer Fee Prediction","Daniil Sulimov","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","We developed an artificial intelligence approach to predict the transfer fee of a football player. This model can help clubs make better decisions about which players to buy and sell, which can lead to improved performance and increased club budgets. Having collected data on player performance, transfer fees, and other factors that might affect a player's value, we then used this data to train a machine learning model that can accurately predict a player's impact on the game. We further passed the obtained results as one of the features to the predictor of transfer fees. The model can help clubs identify players who are undervalued and who could be sold for a profit. It can also help clubs avoid overpaying for players. We believe that our model can be a valuable tool for football clubs. It can help them make better decisions about player recruitment and transfers.","Tue, 30 Jan 2024 07:16:09 UTC (555 KB)"

Lopez","Applications (stat.AP)","The existence and justification to the home advantage -- the benefit a sports team receives when playing at home -- has been studied across sport. The majority of research on this topic is limited to individual leagues in short time frames, which hinders extrapolation and a deeper understanding of possible causes. Using nearly two decades of data from the National Football League (NFL), the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), and high schools from across the United States, we provide a uniform approach to understanding the home advantage in American football. Our findings suggest home advantage in declining in the NFL and the highest levels of collegiate football, but not in amateur football. This increases the possibility that characteristics of the NCAA and NFL, such as travel improvements and instant replay, have helped level the playing field.","Mon, 29 Jan 2024 18:33:22 UTC (2,494 KB)"

Notwithstanding their outstanding performance in familiar environments, these systems often falter in new situations due to overfitting during the training phase. This is especially pronounced in settings where both cooperative and competitive behaviours are present, encapsulating a dual nature of overfitting and generalisation challenges. To address this issue, we present Multi-Agent Diagnostics for Robustness via Illuminated Diversity (MADRID), a novel approach for generating diverse adversarial scenarios that expose strategic vulnerabilities in pre-trained multi-agent policies. Leveraging the concepts from open-ended learning, MADRID navigates the vast space of adversarial settings, employing a target policy's regret to gauge the vulnerabilities of these settings. We evaluate the effectiveness of MADRID on the 11vs11 version of Google Research Football, one of the most complex environments for multi-agent reinforcement learning. Specifically, we employ MADRID for generating a diverse array of adversarial settings for TiZero, the state-of-the-art approach which ""masters"" the game through 45 days of training on a large-scale distributed infrastructure. We expose key shortcomings in TiZero's tactical decision-making, underlining the crucial importance of rigorous evaluation in multi-agent systems.","Wed, 24 Jan 2024 14:02:09 UTC (3,085 KB)"
12,"Backpropagation Through Agents","Zhiyuan Li, Wenshuai Zhao, Lijun Wu, Joni Pajarinen","Multiagent Systems (cs.MA)","A fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is to learn the joint policy in an extremely large search space, which grows exponentially with the number of agents. Moreover, fully decentralized policy factorization significantly restricts the search space, which may lead to sub-optimal policies. In contrast, the auto-regressive joint policy can represent a much richer class of joint policies by factorizing the joint policy into the product of a series of conditional individual policies. While such factorization introduces the action dependency among agents explicitly in sequential execution, it does not take full advantage of the dependency during learning. In particular, the subsequent agents do not give the preceding agents feedback about their decisions. In this paper, we propose a new framework Back-Propagation Through Agents (BPTA) that directly accounts for both agents' own policy updates and the learning of their dependent counterparts. This is achieved by propagating the feedback through action chains. With the proposed framework, our Bidirectional Proximal Policy Optimisation (BPPO) outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on matrix games, StarCraftII v2, Multi-agent MuJoCo, and Google Research Football demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","Tue, 23 Jan 2024 09:07:31 UTC (1,777 KB)"

Modeled on the dynamics of biological swarms, CSI enables the reasoning benefits of small-groups with the collective intelligence benefits of large-groups. In this pilot study, groups of 25 to 30 participants were asked to select players for a weekly Fantasy Football contest over an 11-week period. As a baseline, participants filled out a survey to record their player selections. As an experimental method, participants engaged in a real-time text-chat deliberation using a CSI platform called Thinkscape to collaboratively select sets of players. The results show that the real-time conversational group using CSI outperformed 66% of survey participants, demonstrating significant amplification of intelligence versus the median individual (p=0.020). The CSI method also significantly outperformed the most popular choices from the survey (the Wisdom of Crowd, p<0.001). These results suggest that CSI is an effective technology for amplifying the intelligence of groups engaged in real-time large-scale conversational deliberation and may offer a path to collective superintelligence.","Tue, 19 Dec 2023 21:46:14 UTC (512 KB)"
16,"TimeGraphs: Graph-based Temporal Reasoning","Paridhi Maheshwari, Hongyu Ren, Yanan Wang, Rok Sosic, Jure Leskovec","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Many real-world systems exhibit temporal, dynamic behaviors, which are captured as time series of complex agent interactions. To perform temporal reasoning, current methods primarily encode temporal dynamics through simple sequence-based models. However, in general these models fail to efficiently capture the full spectrum of rich dynamics in the input, since the dynamics is not uniformly distributed. In particular, relevant information might be harder to extract and computing power is wasted for processing all individual timesteps, even if they contain no significant changes or no new information. Here we propose TimeGraphs, a novel approach that characterizes dynamic interactions as a hierarchical temporal graph, diverging from traditional sequential representations. Our approach models the interactions using a compact graph-based representation, enabling adaptive reasoning across diverse time scales. Adopting a self-supervised method, TimeGraphs constructs a multi-level event hierarchy from a temporal input, which is then used to efficiently reason about the unevenly distributed dynamics. This construction process is scalable and incremental to accommodate streaming data. We evaluate TimeGraphs on multiple datasets with complex, dynamic agent interactions, including a football simulator, the Resistance game, and the MOMA human activity dataset. The results demonstrate both robustness and efficiency of TimeGraphs on a range of temporal reasoning tasks. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art performance and leads to a performance increase of up to 12.2% on event prediction and recognition tasks over current approaches. Our experiments further demonstrate a wide array of capabilities including zero-shot generalization, robustness in case of data sparsity, and adaptability to streaming data flow.","Sat, 6 Jan 2024 06:26:49 UTC (5,823 KB)"

However, training a multi-agent reinforcement learning network is a formidable endeavor, demanding substantial computational resources to interact with diverse environmental variables, extract state representations, and acquire decision-making knowledge. The recent breakthroughs in large-scale pre-trained models ignite our curiosity: Can we uncover shared knowledge in multi-agent reinforcement learning and leverage pre-trained models to expedite training for future tasks? Addressing this issue, we present an innovative multi-task learning approach that aims to extract and harness common decision-making knowledge, like cooperation and competition, across different tasks. Our approach involves concurrent training of multiple multi-agent tasks, with each task employing independent front-end perception layers while sharing back-end decision-making layers. This effective decoupling of state representation extraction from decision-making allows for more efficient training and better transferability. To evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach, we conduct comprehensive experiments in two distinct environments: the StarCraft Multi-agent Challenge (SMAC) and the Google Research Football (GRF) environments. The experimental results unequivocally demonstrate the smooth transferability of the shared decision-making network to other tasks, thereby significantly reducing training costs and improving final performance. Furthermore, visualizations authenticate the presence of general multi-agent decision-making knowledge within the shared network layers, further validating the effectiveness of our approach.","Mon, 25 Dec 2023 09:46:50 UTC (31,488 KB)"

Despite fruitful progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning, the challenge of addressing the dynamics of whether two agents should exhibit consistent behaviors is still under-explored. In this paper, we propose a new approach that enables agents to learn whether their behaviors should be consistent with that of other agents by utilizing intrinsic rewards to learn the optimal policy for each agent. We begin by defining behavior consistency as the divergence in output actions between two agents when provided with the same observation. Subsequently, we introduce dynamic consistency intrinsic reward (DCIR) to stimulate agents to be aware of others' behaviors and determine whether to be consistent with them. Lastly, we devise a dynamic scale network (DSN) that provides learnable scale factors for the agent at every time step to dynamically ascertain whether to award consistent behavior and the magnitude of rewards. We evaluate DCIR in multiple environments including Multi-agent Particle, Google Research Football and StarCraft II Micromanagement, demonstrating its efficacy.","Sun, 10 Dec 2023 06:03:57 UTC (300 KB)"

Single-frame supervision has emerged as a labor-efficient way to train action localizers as it requires only one annotated frame per action. However, it often suffers from poor performance due to the lack of precise boundary annotations. To address this issue, we propose a visual analysis method that aligns similar actions and then propagates a few user-provided annotations (e.g. , boundaries, category labels) to similar actions via the generated alignments. Our method models the alignment between actions as a heaviest path problem and the annotation propagation as a quadratic optimization problem. As the automatically generated alignments may not accurately match the associated actions and could produce inaccurate localization results, we develop a storyline visualization to explain the localization results of actions and their alignments. This visualization facilitates users in correcting wrong localization results and misalignments. The corrections are then used to improve the localization results of other actions. The effectiveness of our method in improving localization performance is demonstrated through quantitative evaluation and a case study.","Fri, 8 Dec 2023 17:02:52 UTC (14,960 KB)"

Originally, it was proposed for the ranking system of chess players, but it was soon adapted to many other zero-sum sports fields like football, baseball, basketball , etc. Nowadays, besides the traditional sports games, computer/video games are also playing an important role in social lives especially among the teenagers. In most of the online competition games, player's performance is usually scored and recorded by the game's ranking system. Meanwhile, ranking system like ladder in Dota is not the only the metric for the players to evaluate their gaming strength, an ELO rating score based on players in-game performance is also a decisive factor for gamers' matching. Namely, the matching system will refer to players' score in the ranking system and performance score system to ensure the matched players will promisingly undergo a balanced game without one team dramatically overwhelming the other. ELO scheme and its variants in modern online competition games aims to ensuring the expected winning rate for each team approaches 50\%. However, ELO rating is also causing compliments among players. In this research, I will dig into the advantages and drawbacks of leveraging ELO ranking system in online games and why it is still employed by game developers despite the fact that it is disliked by most of the players. Also, a new effort based rating scheme will be proposed and compared with ELO scheme under the simulation environment.","Wed, 18 Oct 2023 03:38:41 UTC (1,858 KB)"

One potential solution to address this issue lies in the evaluation of the respective league strength. This article endeavors to compute club ratings of the first and second European and South American leagues. In order to calculate these ratings, the authors have designed the Glicko-2 rating system-based approach, which overcomes some Glicko-2 limitations. Particularly, the authors took into consideration the probability of the draw, the home-field advantage, and the property of teams to become stronger or weaker following their league transitions. Furthermore, authors have constructed a predictive model for forecasting match results based on the number of goals scored in previous matches. The metrics utilized in the analysis reveal that the Glicko-2 based approach exhibits a marginally superior level of accuracy when compared to the commonly used Poisson regression-based approach. In addition, Glicko-2 based ratings offer greater interpretability and can find application in various analytics tasks, such as predicting soccer player metrics for forthcoming seasons or the detailed analysis of a player performance in preceding matches. The implementation of the approach is available on this http URL.","Sat, 7 Oct 2023 18:05:11 UTC (63 KB)"

However, doing so algorithmically remains an open research challenge. To address this unmet need, we propose TacticAI, an AI football tactics assistant developed and evaluated in close collaboration with domain experts from Liverpool FC. We focus on analysing corner kicks, as they offer coaches the most direct opportunities for interventions and improvements. TacticAI incorporates both a predictive and a generative component, allowing the coaches to effectively sample and explore alternative player setups for each corner kick routine and to select those with the highest predicted likelihood of success. We validate TacticAI on a number of relevant benchmark tasks: predicting receivers and shot attempts and recommending player position adjustments. The utility of TacticAI is validated by a qualitative study conducted with football domain experts at Liverpool FC. We show that TacticAI's model suggestions are not only indistinguishable from real tactics, but also favoured over existing tactics 90% of the time, and that TacticAI offers an effective corner kick retrieval system. TacticAI achieves these results despite the limited availability of gold-standard data, achieving data efficiency through geometric deep learning.","Mon, 16 Oct 2023 16:25:15 UTC (3,743 KB)[v2] Tue, 17 Oct 2023 13:46:50 UTC (3,743 KB)"

Many relevant approaches have been proposed, utilizing direct feature based, or deep learning methodologies. In this paper, we propose a generalized RANSAC algorithm, H-RANSAC, to retrieve homography image transformations from sets of points without descriptive local feature vectors and point pairing. We allow the points to be optionally labelled in two classes. We propose a robust criterion that rejects implausible point selection before each iteration of RANSAC, based on the type of the quadrilaterals formed by random point pair selection (convex or concave and (non)-self-intersecting). A similar post-hoc criterion rejects implausible homography transformations is included at the end of each iteration. The expected maximum iterations of $H$-RANSAC are derived for different probabilities of success, according to the number of points per image and per class, and the percentage of outliers. The proposed methodology is tested on a large dataset of images acquired by 12 cameras during real football matches, where radically different views at each timestamp are to be matched. Comparisons with state-of-the-art implementations of RANSAC combined with classic and deep learning image salient point detection indicates the superiority of the proposed $H$-RANSAC, in terms of average reprojection error and number of successfully processed pairs of frames, rendering it the method of choice in cases of image homography alignment with few tens of points, while local features are not available, or not descriptive enough.

Curriculum learning is an effective way to accelerate learning, but an under-explored dimension for generating a curriculum is the difficulty-to-learn of the subgames -- games induced by starting from a specific state. In this work, we present a novel subgame curriculum learning framework for zero-sum games. It adopts an adaptive initial state distribution by resetting agents to some previously visited states where they can quickly learn to improve performance. Building upon this framework, we derive a subgame selection metric that approximates the squared distance to NE values and further adopt a particle-based state sampler for subgame generation. Integrating these techniques leads to our new algorithm, Subgame Automatic Curriculum Learning (SACL), which is a realization of the subgame curriculum learning framework. SACL can be combined with any MARL algorithm such as MAPPO. Experiments in the particle-world environment and Google Research Football environment show SACL produces much stronger policies than baselines.

Despite the empirical successes, the theoretical properties of SP-based methods are limited to two-player zero-sum games. However, for mixed cooperative-competitive games where agents on the same team need to cooperate with each other, we can show a simple counter-example where SP-based methods cannot converge to a global Nash equilibrium (NE) with high probability. Alternatively, Policy-Space Response Oracles (PSRO) is an iterative framework for learning NE, where the best responses w.r.t. previous policies are learned in each iteration. PSRO can be directly extended to mixed cooperative-competitive settings by jointly learning team best responses with all convergence properties unchanged. However, PSRO requires repeatedly training joint policies from scratch till convergence, which makes it hard to scale to complex games. In this work, we develop a novel algorithm, Fictitious Cross-Play (FXP), which inherits the benefits from both frameworks. FXP simultaneously trains an SP-based main policy and a counter population of best response policies. The main policy is trained by fictitious self-play and cross-play against the counter population, while the counter policies are trained as the best responses to the main policy's past versions. We validate our method in matrix games and show that FXP converges to global NEs while SP methods fail. We also conduct experiments in a gridworld domain, where FXP achieves higher Elo ratings and lower exploitabilities than baselines, and a more challenging football game, where FXP defeats SOTA models with over 94% win rate.","Thu, 5 Oct 2023 07:19:33 UTC (3,133 KB)"

Users select players for their lineup to maximize their FPTS within a set player salary cap. This paper focuses on (1) the development of a method to forecast NFL player performance under uncertainty and (2) determining an optimal lineup to maximize FPTS under a set salary limit. A supervised learning neural network was created and used to project FPTS based on past player performance (2018 NFL regular season for this work) prior to the upcoming week. These projected FPTS were used in a mixed integer linear program to find the optimal lineup. The performance of resultant lineups was compared to randomly-created lineups. On average, the optimal lineups outperformed the random lineups. The generated lineups were then compared to real-world lineups from users on DraftKings. The generated lineups generally fell in approximately the 31st percentile (median).

Furthermore, the challenging 5-vs-5 and 11-vs-11 full-game scenarios have received limited thorough examination due to their substantial training complexities. To address these gaps, this paper extends the original environment by not only standardizing the environment settings and benchmarking cooperative learning algorithms across different scenarios, including the most challenging full-game scenarios, but also by discussing approaches to enhance football AI from diverse perspectives and introducing related research tools. Specifically, we provide a distributed and asynchronous population-based self-play framework with diverse pre-trained policies for faster training, two football-specific analytical tools for deeper investigation, and an online leaderboard for broader evaluation.

This research presents a novel deep-learning network architecture which is capable to predict the potential end location of passes and how players' movement before the pass affects the final outcome. Once analysed more than 28,000 pass events, a robust prediction can be achieved with more than 0.7 Top-1 accuracy.

Chan","Applications (stat.AP)","For decades, National Football League (NFL) coaches' observed fourth down decisions have been largely inconsistent with prescriptions based on statistical models. In this paper, we develop a framework to explain this discrepancy using a novel inverse optimization approach. We model the fourth down decision and the subsequent sequence of plays in a game as a Markov decision process (MDP), the dynamics of which we estimate from NFL play-by-play data from the 2014 through 2022 seasons. We assume that coaches' observed decisions are optimal but that the risk preferences governing their decisions are unknown. This yields a novel inverse decision problem for which the optimality criterion, or risk measure, of the MDP is the estimand. Using the quantile function to parameterize risk, we estimate which quantile-optimal policy yields the coaches' observed decisions as minimally suboptimal. In general, we find that coaches' fourth-down behavior is consistent with optimizing low quantiles of the next-state value distribution, which corresponds to conservative risk preferences. We also find that coaches exhibit higher risk tolerances when making decisions in the opponent's half of the field than in their own, and that league average fourth down risk tolerances have increased over the seasons in our data.","Fri, 1 Sep 2023 23:06:26 UTC (2,549 KB)"

Then, we propose a novel formation-aware exploration (FoX) framework that encourages partially observable agents to visit the states in diverse formations by guiding them to be well aware of their current formation solely based on their own observations.

To address these issues, novel nonparametric static (ROBART) and autoregressive (ARROBART) models are introduced, with latent scores defined as nonlinear Bayesian additive regression tree functions of covariates. To make inferences in the dynamic ARROBART model, closed-form filtering, predictive, and smoothing distributions for the latent time-varying scores are derived. These results are applied in a Gibbs sampler with data augmentation for posterior inference. The proposed methods are shown to outperform existing competitors in simulation studies, and the advantages of the dynamic model are demonstrated by forecasts of weekly pollster rankings of NCAA football teams.","Sun, 20 Aug 2023 11:26:28 UTC (180 KB)[v2] Thu, 1 Feb 2024 11:43:22 UTC (5,279 KB)"

We investigated this fundamental aspect of motor control in the setting of autonomous robotic operations. We approach this problem by hierarchical generative modelling equipped with multi-level planning-for autonomous task completion-that mimics the deep temporal architecture of human motor control. Here, temporal depth refers to the nested time scales at which successive levels of a forward or generative model unfold, for example, delivering an object requires a global plan to contextualise the fast coordination of multiple local movements of limbs. This separation of temporal scales also motivates robotics and control. Specifically, to achieve versatile sensorimotor control, it is advantageous to hierarchically structure the planning and low-level motor control of individual limbs. We use numerical and physical simulation to conduct experiments and to establish the efficacy of this formulation. Using a hierarchical generative model, we show how a humanoid robot can autonomously complete a complex task that necessitates a holistic use of locomotion, manipulation, and grasping. Specifically, we demonstrate the ability of a humanoid robot that can retrieve and transport a box, open and walk through a door to reach the destination, approach and kick a football, while showing robust performance in presence of body damage and ground irregularities. Our findings demonstrated the effectiveness of using human-inspired motor control algorithms, and our method provides a viable hierarchical architecture for the autonomous completion of challenging goal-directed tasks.","Tue, 15 Aug 2023 13:51:03 UTC (1,913 KB)"

Yeung, Keisuke Fujii","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Complex interactions between two opposing agents frequently occur in domains of machine learning, game theory, and other application domains. Quantitatively analyzing the strategies involved can provide an objective basis for decision-making. One such critical scenario is shot-taking in football, where decisions, such as whether the attacker should shoot or pass the ball and whether the defender should attempt to block the shot, play a crucial role in the outcome of the game. However, there are currently no effective data-driven and/or theory-based approaches to analyzing such situations. To address this issue, we proposed a novel framework to analyze such scenarios based on game theory, where we estimate the expected payoff with machine learning (ML) models, and additional features for ML models were extracted with a theory-based shot block model. Conventionally, successes or failures (1 or 0) are used as payoffs, while a success shot (goal) is extremely rare in football. Therefore, we proposed the Expected Probability of Shot On Target (xSOT) metric to evaluate players' actions even if the shot results in no goal; this allows for effective differentiation and comparison between different shots and even enables counterfactual shot situation analysis. In our experiments, we have validated the framework by comparing it with baseline and ablated models. Furthermore, we have observed a high correlation between the xSOT and existing metrics. This alignment of information suggests that xSOT provides valuable insights. Lastly, as an illustration, we studied optimal strategies in the World Cup 2022 and analyzed a shot situation in EURO 2020.","Thu, 27 Jul 2023 09:42:25 UTC (2,214 KB)"

Based on the MaxEnt framework, we propose Heterogeneous-Agent Soft Actor-Critic (HASAC) algorithm. Theoretically, we prove the monotonic improvement and convergence to quantal response equilibrium (QRE) properties of HASAC. Furthermore, we generalize a unified template for MaxEnt algorithmic design named Maximum Entropy Heterogeneous-Agent Mirror Learning (MEHAML), which provides any induced method with the same guarantees as HASAC. We evaluate HASAC on six benchmarks: Bi-DexHands, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge, Google Research Football, Multi-Agent Particle Environment, and Light Aircraft Game. Results show that HASAC consistently outperforms strong baselines, exhibiting better sample efficiency, robustness, and sufficient exploration.

Thanks to the Cheltsov--Rubinstein classification, this amounts to considering 10 families. In 8 families the problem has been solved by work of Cheltsov--Rubinstein, Fujita and Mazzeo--Rubinstein. The remaining 2 families are rational surfaces parameterized by the self-intersection of the 0-section $n$ and the number of blow-ups $m$. By Cheltsov--Rubinstein, Cheltsov--Rubinstein--Zhang and Fujita, Kähler--Einstein edge metrics exist when either $m=0$ or $m\geq3$ for the first family, and the cases $m=1,2$ have been studied by Fujita--Liu--Süss--Zhang--Zhuang and Fujita. The final remaining family, denoted $\mathrm{(II.6A.n.m)}$ in the Cheltsov--Rubinstein classification, is more difficult as the boundary consists of two components, unlike any of the other 9 families. It is the generalization of the football to complex surfaces with the pair $\mathrm{(II.6A.0.0)}$ being exactly the football times $\mathbb{P}^1$. The pairs $\mathrm{(II.6A.n.0)}$ have been completely understood by the work of Rubinstein--Zhang using the $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundle structure of Hirzebruch surfaces. This article studies the family $\mathrm{(II.6A.n.m)}$ for $m\geq1$. These pairs no longer have a $\mathbb{P}^1$-bundle structure and are therefore more difficult to tackle. The main result is a necessary and sufficient condition on the angles for the existence of Kähler--Einstein edge metrics, generalizing the Rubinstein--Zhang condition. Thus, we resolve the Cheltsov--Rubinstein problem for strongly asymptotically log del Pezzo surfaces.","Mon, 12 Jun 2023 17:58:43 UTC (18 KB)"

Cecchi, Enora Le Flao, Olivier Gevaert, Michael M. Zeineh, David B. Camarillo","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Machine learning head models (MLHMs) are developed to estimate brain deformation for early detection of traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the overfitting to simulated impacts and the lack of generalizability caused by distributional shift of different head impact datasets hinders the broad clinical applications of current MLHMs. We propose brain deformation estimators that integrates unsupervised domain adaptation with a deep neural network to predict whole-brain maximum principal strain (MPS) and MPS rate (MPSR). With 12,780 simulated head impacts, we performed unsupervised domain adaptation on on-field head impacts from 302 college football (CF) impacts and 457 mixed martial arts (MMA) impacts using domain regularized component analysis (DRCA) and cycle-GAN-based methods. The new model improved the MPS/MPSR estimation accuracy, with the DRCA method significantly outperforming other domain adaptation methods in prediction accuracy (p<0.001): MPS RMSE: 0.027 (CF) and 0.037 (MMA); MPSR RMSE: 7.159 (CF) and 13.022 (MMA). On another two hold-out test sets with 195 college football impacts and 260 boxing impacts, the DRCA model significantly outperformed the baseline model without domain adaptation in MPS and MPSR estimation accuracy (p<0.001). The DRCA domain adaptation reduces the MPS/MPSR estimation error to be well below TBI thresholds, enabling accurate brain deformation estimation to detect TBI in future clinical applications.","Thu, 8 Jun 2023 14:52:56 UTC (2,327 KB)"

Previous studies using deep reinforcement learning have often considered teams as a single agent and valued the teams and players who hold the ball in each discrete event. Then it was challenging to value the actions of multiple players, including players far from the ball, in a spatiotemporally continuous state space. In this paper, we propose a method of valuing possible actions for on- and off-ball soccer players in a single holistic framework based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. We consider a discrete action space in a continuous state space that mimics that of Google research football and leverages supervised learning for actions in reinforcement learning. In the experiment, we analyzed the relationships with conventional indicators, season goals, and game ratings by experts, and showed the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our approach can assess how multiple players move continuously throughout the game, which is difficult to be discretized or labeled but vital for teamwork, scouting, and fan engagement.","Mon, 29 May 2023 05:14:36 UTC (1,427 KB)[v2] Fri, 1 Dec 2023 13:51:24 UTC (1,427 KB)"
58,"Is Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution Framework Centralized Enough for MARL?","Yihe Zhou, Shunyu Liu, Yunpeng Qing, Kaixuan Chen, Tongya Zheng, Yanhao Huang, Jie Song, Mingli Song","Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI)","Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has recently emerged as a popular framework for cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), where agents can use additional global state information to guide training in a centralized way and make their own decisions only based on decentralized local policies. Despite the encouraging results achieved, CTDE makes an independence assumption on agent policies, which limits agents to adopt global cooperative information from each other during centralized training. Therefore, we argue that existing CTDE methods cannot fully utilize global information for training, leading to an inefficient joint-policy exploration and even suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce a novel Centralized Advising and Decentralized Pruning (CADP) framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning, that not only enables an efficacious message exchange among agents during training but also guarantees the independent policies for execution. Firstly, CADP endows agents the explicit communication channel to seek and take advices from different agents for more centralized training. To further ensure the decentralized execution, we propose a smooth model pruning mechanism to progressively constraint the agent communication into a closed one without degradation in agent cooperation capability. Empirical evaluations on StarCraft II micromanagement and Google Research Football benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts. Our code will be made publicly available.","Sat, 27 May 2023 03:15:24 UTC (3,307 KB)"

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful framework to generate flexible and diverse behaviors in cyberspace; however, when modeling real-world biological multi-agents, there is a domain gap between behaviors in the source (i.e., real-world data) and the target (i.e., cyberspace for RL), and the source environment parameters are usually unknown. In this paper, we propose a method for adaptive action supervision in RL from real-world demonstrations in multi-agent scenarios. We adopt an approach that combines RL and supervised learning by selecting actions of demonstrations in RL based on the minimum distance of dynamic time warping for utilizing the information of the unknown source dynamics. This approach can be easily applied to many existing neural network architectures and provide us with an RL model balanced between reproducibility as imitation and generalization ability to obtain rewards in cyberspace. In the experiments, using chase-and-escape and football tasks with the different dynamics between the unknown source and target environments, we show that our approach achieved a balance between the reproducibility and the generalization ability compared with the baselines. In particular, we used the tracking data of professional football players as expert demonstrations in football and show successful performances despite the larger gap between behaviors in the source and target environments than the chase-and-escape task.","Mon, 22 May 2023 13:33:37 UTC (7,257 KB)[v2] Sat, 27 May 2023 01:56:14 UTC (7,257 KB)[v3] Fri, 15 Dec 2023 09:20:57 UTC (7,257 KB)[v4] Tue, 19 Dec 2023 13:29:33 UTC (7,256 KB)"

Matthews","Applications (stat.AP)","In American football, a pass rush is an attempt by the defensive team to disrupt the offense and prevent the quarterback (QB) from completing a pass. Existing metrics for assessing pass rush performance are either discrete-time quantities or based on subjective judgment. Using player tracking data, we propose STRAIN, a novel metric for evaluating pass rushers in the National Football League (NFL) at the continuous-time within-play level. Inspired by the concept of strain rate in materials science, STRAIN is a simple and interpretable means for measuring defensive pressure in football. It is a directly-observed statistic as a function of two features: the distance between the pass rusher and QB, and the rate at which this distance is being reduced. Our metric possesses great predictability of pressure and stability over time. We also fit a multilevel model for STRAIN to understand the defensive pressure contribution of every pass rusher at the play-level. We apply our approach to NFL data and present results for the first eight weeks of the 2021 regular season. In particular, we provide comparisons of STRAIN for different defensive positions and play outcomes, and rankings of the NFL's best pass rushers according to our metric.","Wed, 17 May 2023 14:52:49 UTC (113 KB)[v2] Thu, 20 Jul 2023 17:54:26 UTC (190 KB)[v3] Mon, 31 Jul 2023 01:40:24 UTC (187 KB)"

In our framework, a threat is defined as entering the opposing team's danger area. We investigate the timing of threat events and ball touches of players, and capture their correlation using Hawkes processes. Our model-based approach allows us to evaluate a player's ability to create danger both directly and through interactions with teammates. We define a new index, called Generation of Threat (GoT), that measures in an unbiased way the contribution of a player to threat generation. For illustration, we present a detailed analysis of Chelsea's 2016-2017 season, with a standout performance from Eden Hazard.

Yet existing MOT benchmarks cast little attention on the domain, limiting its development. In this work, we present a new large-scale multi-object tracking dataset in diverse sports scenes, coined as \emph{SportsMOT}, where all players on the court are supposed to be tracked. It consists of 240 video sequences, over 150K frames (almost 15\times MOT17) and over 1.6M bounding boxes (3\times MOT17) collected from 3 sports categories, including basketball, volleyball and football. Our dataset is characterized with two key properties: 1) fast and variable-speed motion and 2) similar yet distinguishable appearance. We expect SportsMOT to encourage the MOT trackers to promote in both motion-based association and appearance-based association. We benchmark several state-of-the-art trackers and reveal the key challenge of SportsMOT lies in object association. To alleviate the issue, we further propose a new multi-object tracking framework, termed as \emph{MixSort}, introducing a MixFormer-like structure as an auxiliary association model to prevailing tracking-by-detection trackers. By integrating the customized appearance-based association with the original motion-based association, MixSort achieves state-of-the-art performance on SportsMOT and MOT17.

Analyzing football videos is challenging and requires identifying subtle and diverse spatio-temporal patterns. Despite recent advances in computer vision, current algorithms still face significant challenges when learning from limited annotated data, lowering their performance in detecting these patterns. In this paper, we propose an active learning framework that selects the most informative video samples to be annotated next, thus drastically reducing the annotation effort and accelerating the training of action spotting models to reach the highest accuracy at a faster pace. Our approach leverages the notion of uncertainty sampling to select the most challenging video clips to train on next, hastening the learning process of the algorithm. We demonstrate that our proposed active learning framework effectively reduces the required training data for accurate action spotting in football videos. We achieve similar performances for action spotting with NetVLAD++ on SoccerNet-v2, using only one-third of the dataset, indicating significant capabilities for reducing annotation time and improving data efficiency. We further validate our approach on two new datasets that focus on temporally localizing actions of headers and passes, proving its effectiveness across different action semantics in football.

By construction of these events, participants must distinguish the spheroidal ball from not only the background, but also their team and enemy players, which are marked by self-assigned linear combinations of specific frequencies of electromagnetic magnetic radiation, known as uniform color. We investigate chromatic effects on the outcome of such events. We do this by finding the correlation between the color contrast and the success of several key spheroidal ball match tactics. We perform this analysis for the 2020 NFL regular season, focusing on moves in which uniform colors may be a factor in performance. We conduct a primary analysis using each team's cumulative results over the season, but in doing so neglect non-uniformity in the chosen uniform color per individual. We then conduct a secondary analysis of the performance per game of a single team, the Seattle Seahawks, which exhibited large uniform color variability for the 2020 NFL regular season. In this work, tackles and completions are considered. The Pearson correlation coefficient is then calculated for both tactics.

Using Scouting Combine data, we evaluate six different algorithms' ability to predict whether a potential draft pick will play a single NFL snap (matriculation). If a player is drafted, we predict how many snaps they go on to play (success). We are able to predict matriculation with 83% accuracy; however, we are unable to predict later success. Our best performing algorithm returns large error and low explained variance (RMSE=1,210 snaps; ${R}^2$=0.17). These findings indicate that while the Scouting Combine can predict NFL matriculation, it may not be a reliable predictor of long-term player success.","Fri, 10 Mar 2023 08:19:35 UTC (66 KB)"

Such data consist of interactions among players of competing teams indexed by space and time. High-resolution network data are vital to understanding and predicting the performance of teams, because the performance of a team is more than the sum of the strengths of its individual players: Whether a collection of players forms a strong team depends on the strength of the individual players as well as the interactions among the players. We introduce a continuous-time stochastic process as a model of interactions among players of competing teams indexed by space and time, discuss basic properties of the continuous-time stochastic process, and learn the stochastic process from high-resolution network data by pursuing a Bayesian approach. We present simulation results along with an application to Juventus Turin, Inter Milan, and other football clubs in the premier Italian soccer league.","Thu, 2 Mar 2023 14:49:52 UTC (230 KB)[v2] Mon, 12 Feb 2024 23:49:21 UTC (1,282 KB)"

As there are various pattern mining algorithms, this study aimed to validate which algorithm discovers the best set of movement patterns for player movement profiling in professional rugby league and the similarity in extracted movement patterns between the algorithms. Three pattern mining algorithms (l-length Closed Contiguous [LCCspm], Longest Common Subsequence [LCS] and AprioriClose) were used to profile elite rugby football league hookers (n = 22 players) and wingers (n = 28 players) match-games movements across 319 matches. Machine learning classification algorithms were used to identify which algorithm gives the best set of movement patterns to separate playing positions with Jaccard similarity score identifying the extent of similarity between algorithms' movement patterns. LCCspm and LCS movement patterns shared a 0.19 Jaccard similarity score. AprioriClose movement patterns shared no significant similarity with LCCspm and LCS patterns. The closed contiguous movement patterns profiled by LCCspm best-separated players into playing positions. Multi-layered Perceptron algorithm achieved the highest accuracy of 91.02% and precision, recall and F1 scores of 0.91 respectively. Therefore, we recommend the extraction of closed contiguous (consecutive) over non-consecutive movement patterns for separating groups of players.","Sat, 25 Feb 2023 12:23:32 UTC (788 KB)"

Murray","Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)","Purpose The objective of this study is to present preliminary on-field head kinematics data for NCAA Division I American football players through closely matched pre-season workouts both with and without Guardian Caps (GCs). Methods 42 NCAA Division I American football players wore instrumented mouthguards (iMMs) for 6 closely matched workouts, 3 in traditional helmets (PRE) and 3 with GCs (POST) affixed to the exterior of their helmets. This includes 7 players who had consistent data through all workouts. Results There was no significant difference between the collapsed mean values for the entire sample between PRE and POST for peak linear acceleration (PLA) (PRE=16.3, POST=17.2Gs; p=0.20), Peak Angular Acceleration (PAA) (PRE=992.1, POST=1029.4rad/s2; p=0.51 and the total amount of impacts (PRE=9.3, POST=9.7; p=0.72). Similarly, no difference was observed between PRE and POST for PLA (PRE=16.1, POST=17.2Gs; p=0.32), PAA (PRE=951.2, POST=1038.0rad/s2; p=0.29 and total impacts (PRE=9.6, POST=9.7; p=0.32) between sessions for the 7 repeated players. Conclusion These data suggest no difference in head kinematics data (PLA, PAA and total impacts) when GCs are worn. This study suggests GCs are not effective in reducing the magnitude of head impacts experienced by NCAA Division I American football players.","Tue, 21 Feb 2023 22:44:51 UTC (232 KB)"

However, most sports sequential events modeling methods and performance metrics approaches could be incomprehensive in dealing with such large-scale spatiotemporal data (in particular, temporal process), thereby necessitating a more comprehensive spatiotemporal model and a holistic performance metric. To this end, we proposed the Transformer-Based Neural Marked Spatio Temporal Point Process (NMSTPP) model for football event data based on the neural temporal point processes (NTPP) framework. In the experiments, our model outperformed the prediction performance of the baseline models. Furthermore, we proposed the holistic possession utilization score (HPUS) metric for a more comprehensive football possession analysis. For verification, we examined the relationship with football teams' final ranking, average goal score, and average xG over a season. It was observed that the average HPUS showed significant correlations regardless of not using goal and details of shot information. Furthermore, we show HPUS examples in analyzing possessions, matches, and between matches.","Sat, 18 Feb 2023 10:02:45 UTC (3,267 KB)"

Existing MAS problems typically use uniform timesteps with observations for all agents. In this work, we analyse the problem of agent location imputation, specifically posed in environments with non-uniform timesteps and limited agent observability (~95% missing values). Our approach uses Long Short-Term Memory and Graph Neural Network components to learn temporal and inter-agent patterns to predict the location of all agents at every timestep. We apply this to the domain of football (soccer) by imputing the location of all players in a game from sparse event data (e.g., shots and passes). Our model estimates player locations to within ~6.9m; a ~62% reduction in error from the best performing baseline. This approach facilitates downstream analysis tasks such as player physical metrics, player coverage, and team pitch control. Existing solutions to these tasks often require optical tracking data, which is expensive to obtain and only available to elite clubs. By imputing player locations from easy to obtain event data, we increase the accessibility of downstream tasks.","Mon, 13 Feb 2023 18:13:29 UTC (2,586 KB)"

In-depth analysis of football player data by humans is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires a lot of effort. This exploratory study demonstrates the feasibility of using a machine learning algorithm to enhance the effectiveness of player monitoring and training. The suggested approach uses machine learning to generate analytical insights and enable long-term monitoring of player performance. In the future, machine learning could use this technique to offer constructive criticism of football players. The system incorporates a homemade ball-throwing mechanism capable of launching the ball in a variety of directions and at varying velocities. The ball kicker is equipped with a gyroscope and accelerometer sensors for measuring velocity and acceleration. The gathered data is filtered initially, and then the data that has been processed is fed into the machine-learning algorithm. The algorithm will be trained on player performance data and will be able to provide real-time feedback to coaches on player performance and potential areas for improvement. Additionally, the system will be able to track player progress over time and provide coaches with a comprehensive view of player development.

This technology has a very wide application in sports analysis, games, virtual reality, human animation and other fields. The traditional three-dimensional small target detection technology has the disadvantages of high cost, low precision and inconvenience, so it is difficult to apply in practice. With the development of machine learning and deep learning, the technology of computer vision algorithms is becoming more mature. Creating an immersive media experience is considered to be a very important research work in sports. The main work is to explore and solve the problem of football detection under the multiple cameras, aiming at the research and implementation of the live broadcast system of football matches. Using multi cameras detects a target ball and determines its position in three dimension with the occlusion, motion, low illumination of the target object. This paper designed and implemented football detection system under multiple cameras for the detection and capture of targets in real-time matches. The main work mainly consists of three parts, football detector, single camera detection, and multi-cameras detection. The system used bundle adjustment to obtain the three-dimensional position of the target, and the GPU to accelerates data pre-processing and achieve accurate real-time capture of the target. By testing the system, it shows that the system can accurately detect and capture the moving targets in 3D. In addition, the solution in this paper is reusable for large-scale competitions, like basketball and soccer. The system framework can be well transplanted into other similar engineering project systems. It has been put into the market.","Tue, 31 Jan 2023 22:04:53 UTC (18,803 KB)"

Hewitt, Oktay Karakus","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Football is a very result-driven industry, with goals being rarer than in most sports, so having further parameters to judge the performance of teams and individuals is key. Expected Goals (xG) allow further insight than just a scoreline. To tackle the need for further analysis in football, this paper uses machine learning applications that are developed and applied to Football Event data. From the concept, a Binary Classification problem is created whereby a probabilistic valuation is outputted using Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting based approaches. The model successfully predicts xGs probability values for football players based on 15,575 shots. The proposed solution utilises StatsBomb as the data provider and an industry benchmark to tune the models in the right direction. The proposed ML solution for xG is further used to tackle the age-old cliche of: 'the ball has fallen to the wrong guy there'. The development of the model is used to adjust and gain more realistic values of expected goals than the general models show. To achieve this, this paper tackles Positional Adjusted xG, splitting the training data into Forward, Midfield, and Defence with the aim of providing insight into player qualities based on their positional sub-group. Positional Adjusted xG successfully predicts and proves that more attacking players are better at accumulating xG. The highest value belonged to Forwards followed by Midfielders and Defenders. Finally, this study has further developments into Player Adjusted xG with the aim of proving that Messi is statistically at a higher efficiency level than the average footballer. This is achieved by using Messi subset samples to quantify his qualities in comparison to the average xG models finding that Messi xG performs 347 xG higher than the general model outcome.","Thu, 19 Jan 2023 22:17:38 UTC (942 KB)[v2] Tue, 2 May 2023 11:30:04 UTC (5,100 KB)"

Access to sports facilities depends on multiple factors, such as geographic location, proximity to population centers, budgetary constraints, and other socio-economic covariates. Here we show how an optimal allocation of government funds towards sports facilitators (e.g. sports clubs) can be achieved in a data-driven simulation model that maximizes children's access to sports facilities. We compile a dataset for all 1,854 football clubs in Austria, including estimates for their budget, geolocation, tally, and the age profile of their members. We find a characteristic sub-linear relationship between the number of active club members and the budget, which depends on the socio-economic conditions of the clubs' municipality. In the model, where we assume this relationship to be causal, we evaluate different funding strategies. We show that an optimization strategy where funds are distributed based on regional socio-economic characteristics and club budgets outperforms a naive approach by up to 117\% in attracting children to sports clubs for 5 million Euros of additional funding. Our results suggest that the impact of public funding strategies can be substantially increased by tailoring them to regional socio-economic characteristics in an evidence-based and individualized way.","Wed, 21 Dec 2022 13:55:26 UTC (3,101 KB)"

Leveraging this point, we propose a two-level hierarchical architecture that combines a novel information-theoretic objective with a trajectory prediction model to learn a strategy. To this end, we introduce a latent policy that learns two types of latent strategies: individual $z_A$, and relational $z_R$ using a modified Graph Attention Network module to extract interaction features.

Starting from first principle, in this paper, we manage to solve the non-stationarity problem by proposing bidirectional action-dependent Q-learning (ACE). Central to the development of ACE is the sequential decision-making process wherein only one agent is allowed to take action at one time. Within this process, each agent maximizes its value function given the actions taken by the preceding agents at the inference stage. In the learning phase, each agent minimizes the TD error that is dependent on how the subsequent agents have reacted to their chosen action. Given the design of bidirectional dependency, ACE effectively turns a multiagent MDP into a single-agent MDP. We implement the ACE framework by identifying the proper network representation to formulate the action dependency, so that the sequential decision process is computed implicitly in one forward pass. To validate ACE, we compare it with strong baselines on two MARL benchmarks. Empirical experiments demonstrate that ACE outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms on Google Research Football and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge by a large margin. In particular, on SMAC tasks, ACE achieves 100% success rate on almost all the hard and super-hard maps.

The addition of the padded helmet shell cover was effective in attenuating the magnitude of angular head accelerations and two brain injury risk metrics (DAMAGE, HARM) across most laboratory impact conditions, but did not significantly attenuate linear head accelerations for all helmets. Overall, HARM values were reduced in laboratory impact tests by an average of 25% at 3.5 m/s (range: 9.7 - 39.6%), 18% at 5.5 m/s (range: -5.5 - 40.5%), and 10% at 7.4 m/s (range: -6.0 - 31.0%). However, on the field, no significant differences in any measure of head impact magnitude were observed between the bare helmet impacts and padded helmet impacts. Further laboratory tests were conducted to evaluate the ability of the padded helmet shell cover to maintain its performance after exposure to repeated, successive impacts and across a range of temperatures. This research provides a detailed assessment of padded helmet shell covers and supports the continuation of in vivo helmet research to validate laboratory testing results.","Sun, 27 Nov 2022 19:38:39 UTC (7,272 KB)"
99,"Axion Free-kick Misalignment Mechanism","Ling-Xiao Xu, Seokhoon Yun","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology (hep-ph)","We propose an alternative scenario for the axion misalignment mechanism based on the nontrivial interplay between the axion and a light dilaton in the early universe. Dark matter abundance is still sourced by the initial misalignment of the axion field, whose motion along the potential kicks the dilaton field away from its minimum, and dilaton starts to oscillate later with a delayed onset time for oscillation and a relatively large misalignment value due to the kick; eventually the dilaton dominates over the axion in their energy densities, and the dilaton is identified as dark matter. The kick effect due to axion motion is the most significant if the initial field value of dilaton is near its minimum; therefore, we call this scenario axion free-kick misalignment mechanism, where axion plays the role similar to a football player. Dark matter abundance can be obtained with a lower axion decay constant compared to the conventional misalignment mechanism.","Wed, 23 Nov 2022 16:03:46 UTC (433 KB)[v2] Thu, 4 May 2023 17:12:26 UTC (597 KB)"

Using a high-frequency dataset provided directly by a major bookmaker, containing the odds and amounts staked throughout German Bundesliga football matches, we test for evidence of momentum in the betting and pricing behaviour after equalising goals. We find that bettors see value in teams that have the apparent momentum, staking about 40% more on them than teams that just conceded an equaliser. Still, there is no evidence that such perceived momentum matters on average for match outcomes or is associated with the bookmaker offering favourable odds. We also confirm that betting on the apparent momentum would lead to substantial losses for bettors.","Fri, 11 Nov 2022 08:07:18 UTC (54 KB)"

Comparing outcomes between sports participants and matched non-sports participants with similar confounders is straightforward. Unfortunately, an analysis based on such a broad exposure cannot probe the possibility that participation in certain types of sports (e.g., collision sports like football or soccer) may have larger effects on health than others. In this study, we introduce a hierarchy of exposure definitions, ranging from broad (participation in any after-school organized activity) to narrow (e.g., participation in limited-contact sports). We will perform separate matched observational studies, one for each definition, to estimate the health effects of several levels of sports participation.

The past decade's advances in rl have led to breakthroughs in many challenging domains such as video games, board games, robotics, and chip design. The sample inefficiency of deep reinforcement learning methods is a significant obstacle when applying rl to real-world problems. Transfer learning has been applied to reinforcement learning such that the knowledge gained in one task can be applied when training in a new task. Curriculum learning is concerned with sequencing tasks or data samples such that knowledge can be transferred between those tasks to learn a target task that would otherwise be too difficult to solve. Designing a curriculum that improves sample efficiency is a complex problem. In this thesis, we propose a teacher-student curriculum learning setting where we simultaneously train a teacher that selects tasks for the student while the student learns how to solve the selected task. Our method is independent of human domain knowledge and manual curriculum design. We evaluated our methods on two reinforcement learning benchmarks: grid world and the challenging Google Football environment. With our method, we can improve the sample efficiency and generality of the student compared to tabula-rasa reinforcement learning.","Mon, 31 Oct 2022 14:45:39 UTC (4,873 KB)"

Despite the same team's offensive and defensive units typically consisting of separate player sets, some aspects of your team's defensive (offensive) performance may affect the complementary side: turnovers forced by your defense could lead to easier scoring chances for your offense, while your offense's ability to control the clock may help your defense. For 2009-2019 CFB seasons, we incorporate natural splines with group penalty approaches to identify the most consistently influential features of complementary football in a data-driven way, conducting partially constrained optimization in order to additionally guarantee the full adjustment for strength of schedule and homefield factor.

Robust RL has been applied to deal with task ambiguity, but may result in over-conservative policies. To balance the worst-case (robustness) and average performance, we propose Group Distributionally Robust Markov Decision Process (GDR-MDP), a flexible hierarchical MDP formulation that encodes task groups via a latent mixture model. GDR-MDP identifies the optimal policy that maximizes the expected return under the worst-possible qualified belief over task groups within an ambiguity set. We rigorously show that GDR-MDP's hierarchical structure improves distributional robustness by adding regularization to the worst possible outcomes. We then develop deep RL algorithms for GDR-MDP for both value-based and policy-based RL methods. Extensive experiments on Box2D control tasks, MuJoCo benchmarks, and Google football platforms show that our algorithms outperform classic robust training algorithms across diverse environments in terms of robustness under belief uncertainties.

In this paper, we in turn explore how to leverage the global information to directly learn a better individual $Q$-function or individual actor. We find that applying the same global information to all agents indiscriminately is not enough for good performance, and thus propose to specify the global information for each agent to obtain agent-specific global information for better performance. Furthermore, we distill such agent-specific global information into the agent's local information, which is used during decentralized execution without too much performance degradation. We call this new paradigm Personalized Training with Distillated Execution (PTDE).

We use machine learning models and historical player data from English Premier League (2020-2022) to predict scores and to understand how individual performance can improve the outcome of a match. We compared different prediction techniques to maximise the possibility of finding useful models.

We used different sets of features and shown goalkeepers stats are more important than attackers stats to predict goals scored. We applied a broad evaluation process to assess the efficacy of the models in real world applications. We managed to predict correctly all relegated teams after forecast 100 consecutive matches.

However, centralized training and dense rewards are not readily available in the real world. Current multi-agent algorithms struggle to learn in the alternative setup of decentralized training or sparse rewards. To address these issues, we propose a self-supervised intrinsic reward ELIGN - expectation alignment - inspired by the self-organization principle in Zoology. Similar to how animals collaborate in a decentralized manner with those in their vicinity, agents trained with expectation alignment learn behaviors that match their neighbors' expectations. This allows the agents to learn collaborative behaviors without any external reward or centralized training. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach across 6 tasks in the multi-agent particle and the complex Google Research football environments, comparing ELIGN to sparse and curiosity-based intrinsic rewards. When the number of agents increases, ELIGN scales well in all multi-agent tasks except for one where agents have different capabilities. We show that agent coordination improves through expectation alignment because agents learn to divide tasks amongst themselves, break coordination symmetries, and confuse adversaries. These results identify tasks where expectation alignment is a more useful strategy than curiosity-driven exploration for multi-agent coordination, enabling agents to do zero-shot coordination.","Sun, 9 Oct 2022 22:24:44 UTC (3,877 KB)[v2] Wed, 9 Nov 2022 19:15:06 UTC (3,878 KB)"

Motor-control behavior has been consistently mapped to the brain's somatomotor network (SM) using both structural (sMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI). However, no studies habe integrated HAE, motor-control behavior, sMRI and fMRI measures. Here, brain networks important for motor-control were hypothesized to show changes in tractography-based diffusion weighted imaging [difference in fractional anisotropy (dFA)] and resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) measures in collegiate American football players across the season, and that these measures would relate to VR-based motor-control. We firther tested if nine inflammation-related miRNAs were associated with behavior-structure-function variables. Using permutation-based mediation and moderation methods, we found that across-season dFA from the SM structural connectome (SM-dFA) mediated the relationship between across-season VR-based Sensory-motor Reactivity (dSR) and rs-fMRI SM fingerprint similarity (p = 0.007 and Teff = 47%). The interaction between dSR and SM-dFA also predicted (pF = 0.036, pbeta3 = 0.058) across-season levels of dmiRNA-30d through permutation-based moderation analysis.

The process of analysing and tagging these images can be costly and error prone (also availability, gaps and legal conundrums). However, as we demonstrate in this article, the potential to generate accurate graphical images that are indistinguishable from real-world sources has a multitude of benefits in machine learning paradigms. One such example of this is football data from broadcast services (television and other streaming media sources). The football games are usually recorded from multiple sources (cameras and phones) and resolutions, not to mention, occlusion of visual details and other artefacts (like blurring, weathering and lighting conditions) which make it difficult to accurately identify features. We demonstrate an approach which is able to overcome these limitations using generated tagged and structured images. The generated images are able to simulate a variety views and conditions (including noise and blurring) which may only occur sporadically in real-world data and make it difficult for machine learning algorithm to 'cope' with these unforeseen problems in real-data.

Given the growing amount of player tracking data, sports analytics models are increasingly utilizing spatially-derived features built upon player tracking data. However, player-specific information, such as location, cannot readily be included as features themselves, since common modeling techniques rely on vector input. Accordingly, spatially-derived features are commonly constructed in relation to anchor objects, such as the distance to a ball or goal, through global feature aggregations, or via role-assignment schemes, where players are designated a distinct role in the game. In doing so, we sacrifice inter-player and local relationships in favor of global ones. To address this issue, we introduce a sport-agnostic graph-based representation of game states. We then use our proposed graph representation as input to graph neural networks to predict sports outcomes. Our approach preserves permutation invariance and allows for flexible player interaction weights. We demonstrate how our method provides statistically significant improvements over the state of the art for prediction tasks in both American football and esports, reducing test set loss by 9% and 20%, respectively.

Models for estimating these are presented and compared. These, along with other predictors are introduced into two Bayesian approaches for the final estimate of in-game home-team win probability. To illustrate utility, methods are applied to the 2021 Big XII Conference Football Championship game between Baylor and Oklahoma State.","Wed, 27 Jul 2022 18:51:51 UTC (557 KB)"

Distance metrics can only serve as proxy for similarity in information retrieval of similar instances. Learning a good similarity function from human annotations improves the quality of retrievals. This work uses deep metric learning to learn these user-defined similarity functions from few annotations for a large football trajectory dataset. We adapt an entropy-based active learning method with recent work from triplet mining to collect easy-to-answer but still informative annotations from human participants and use them to train a deep convolutional network that generalizes to unseen samples. Our user study shows that our approach improves the quality of the information retrieval compared to a previous deep metric learning approach that relies on a Siamese network. Specifically, we shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of passive sampling heuristics and active learners alike by analyzing the participants' response efficacy. To this end, we collect accuracy, algorithmic time complexity, the participants' fatigue and time-to-response, qualitative self-assessment and statements, as well as the effects of mixed-expertise annotators and their consistency on model performance and transfer-learning.","Tue, 26 Jul 2022 07:55:23 UTC (4,262 KB)[v2] Thu, 10 Nov 2022 09:49:18 UTC (4,260 KB)"
126,"Machine Learning Modeling to Evaluate the Value of Football Players","Chenyao Li, Stylianos Kampakis, Philip Treleaven","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","In most sports, especially football, most coaches and analysts search for key performance indicators using notational analysis. This method utilizes a statistical summary of events based on video footage and numerical records of goal scores. Unfortunately, this approach is now obsolete owing to the continuous evolutionary increase in technology that simplifies the analysis of more complex process variables through machine learning (ML). Machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence (AI), uses algorithms to detect meaningful patterns and define a structure based on positional data. This research investigates a new method to evaluate the value of current football players, based on establishing the machine learning models to investigate the relations among the various features of players, the salary of players, and the market value of players. The data of the football players used for this project is from several football websites. The data on the salary of football players will be the proxy for evaluating the value of players, and other features will be used to establish and train the ML model for predicting the suitable salary for the players. The motivation is to explore what are the relations between different features of football players and their salaries - how each feature affects their salaries, or which are the most important features to affect the salary? Although many standards can reflect the value of football players, the salary of the players is one of the most intuitive and crucial indexes, so this study will use the salary of players as the proxy to evaluate their value. Moreover, many features of players can affect the valuation of the football players, but the value of players is mainly decided by three types of factors: basic characteristics, performance on the court, and achievements at the club.","Fri, 22 Jul 2022 22:34:52 UTC (1,273 KB)"

Billoni","Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability (physics.data-an)","In this article, we study the dynamics of marking in football matches. To do this, we surveyed and analyzed a database containing the trajectories of players from both teams on the field of play during three professional games. We describe the dynamics through the construction of temporal bipartite networks of proximity. Based on the introduced concept of proximity, the nodes are the players, and the links are defined between opponents that are close enough to each other at a given moment. By studying the evolution of the heterogeneity parameter of the networks during the game, we characterized a scaling law for the average shape of the fluctuations, unveiling the emergence of complexity in the system. Moreover, we proposed a simple model to simulate the players' motion in the field from where we obtained the evolution of a synthetic proximity network. We show that the model captures with a remarkable agreement the complexity of the empirical case, hence it proves to be helpful to elucidate the underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed phenomena.","Wed, 20 Jul 2022 15:51:58 UTC (622 KB)[v2] Sun, 25 Sep 2022 14:59:51 UTC (644 KB)"

However, previous works mainly consider static, pair-wise interactions with limited relational reasoning. To promote more comprehensive interaction modeling and relational reasoning, we propose DynGroupNet, a dynamic-group-aware network, which can i) model time-varying interactions in highly dynamic scenes; ii) capture both pair-wise and group-wise interactions; and iii) reason both interaction strength and category without direct supervision. Based on DynGroupNet, we further design a prediction system to forecast socially plausible trajectories with dynamic relational reasoning. The proposed prediction system leverages the Gaussian mixture model, multiple sampling and prediction refinement to promote prediction diversity, training stability and trajectory smoothness, respectively. Extensive experiments show that: 1)DynGroupNet can capture time-varying group behaviors, infer time-varying interaction category and interaction strength during trajectory prediction without any relation supervision on physical simulation datasets; 2)DynGroupNet outperforms the state-of-the-art trajectory prediction methods by a significant improvement of 22.6%/28.0%, 26.9%/34.9%, 5.1%/13.0% in ADE/FDE on the NBA, NFL Football and SDD datasets and achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the ETH-UCY dataset.","Mon, 27 Jun 2022 08:36:56 UTC (5,561 KB)"

A typical MARL algorithm of this fashion decomposes a centralized Q-function into local Q-networks with parameters shared across agents. Such an algorithmic paradigm enables centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) and leads to efficient learning in practice. Despite all the advantages, we revisit these two principles and show that in certain scenarios, e.g., environments with a highly multi-modal reward landscape, value decomposition, and parameter sharing can be problematic and lead to undesired outcomes. In contrast, policy gradient (PG) methods with individual policies provably converge to an optimal solution in these cases, which partially supports some recent empirical observations that PG can be effective in many MARL testbeds. Inspired by our theoretical analysis, we present practical suggestions on implementing multi-agent PG algorithms for either high rewards or diverse emergent behaviors and empirically validate our findings on a variety of domains, ranging from the simplified matrix and grid-world games to complex benchmarks such as StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge and Google Research Football.

The score of a match involves randomness and often may not represent the performance of the teams and players, therefore it has been popular to use the alternative statistics in recent years such as shots on target, ball possessions, and drills. To measure the probability of a shot being a goal by the expected goal, several features are used to train an expected goal model which is based on the event and tracking football data. The selection of these features, the size and date of the data, and the model which are used as the parameters that may affect the performance of the model. Using black-box machine learning models for increasing the predictive performance of the model decreases its interpretability that causes the loss of information that can be gathered from the model. This paper proposes an accurate expected goal model trained consisting of 315,430 shots from seven seasons between 2014-15 and 2020-21 of the top-five European football leagues. Moreover, this model is explained by using explainable artificial intelligence tool to obtain an explainable expected goal model for evaluating a team or player performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that demonstrates a practical application of an explainable artificial intelligence tool aggregated profiles to explain a group of observations on an accurate expected goal model for monitoring the team and player performance. Moreover, these methods can be generalized to other sports branches.","Tue, 14 Jun 2022 23:56:03 UTC (1,124 KB)[v2] Tue, 6 Sep 2022 14:02:41 UTC (1,256 KB)"

In this paper, we investigate whether SSL methods can be leveraged for the task of learning accurate state representations of games, and if so, to what extent. For this purpose, we collect game footage frames and corresponding sequences of games' internal state from three different 3D games: VizDoom, the CARLA racing simulator and the Google Research Football Environment. We train an image encoder with three widely used SSL algorithms using solely the raw frames, and then attempt to recover the internal state variables from the learned representations. Our results across all three games showcase significantly higher correlation between SSL representations and the game's internal state compared to pre-trained baseline models such as ImageNet. Such findings suggest that SSL-based visual encoders can yield general -- not tailored to a specific task -- yet informative game representations solely from game pixel information. Such representations can, in turn, form the basis for boosting the performance of downstream learning tasks in games, including gameplaying, content generation and player modeling.","Mon, 13 Jun 2022 21:37:58 UTC (36,715 KB)"

A natural follow-up question is how to abstract multi-agent decision making into an SM problem and benefit from the prosperous development of SMs. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture named Multi-Agent Transformer (MAT) that effectively casts cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) into SM problems wherein the task is to map agents' observation sequence to agents' optimal action sequence. Our goal is to build the bridge between MARL and SMs so that the modeling power of modern sequence models can be unleashed for MARL. Central to our MAT is an encoder-decoder architecture which leverages the multi-agent advantage decomposition theorem to transform the joint policy search problem into a sequential decision making process; this renders only linear time complexity for multi-agent problems and, most importantly, endows MAT with monotonic performance improvement guarantee. Unlike prior arts such as Decision Transformer fit only pre-collected offline data, MAT is trained by online trials and errors from the environment in an on-policy fashion. To validate MAT, we conduct extensive experiments on StarCraftII, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, Dexterous Hands Manipulation, and Google Research Football benchmarks.

For training efficiency and scalability, most of the MARL algorithms make all agents share the same policy or value network. However, in many complex multi-agent tasks, different agents are expected to possess specific abilities to handle different subtasks. In those scenarios, sharing parameters indiscriminately may lead to similar behavior across all agents, which will limit the exploration efficiency and degrade the final performance. To balance the training complexity and the diversity of agent behavior, we propose a novel framework to learn dynamic subtask assignment (LDSA) in cooperative MARL. Specifically, we first introduce a subtask encoder to construct a vector representation for each subtask according to its identity. To reasonably assign agents to different subtasks, we propose an ability-based subtask selection strategy, which can dynamically group agents with similar abilities into the same subtask. In this way, agents dealing with the same subtask share their learning of specific abilities and different subtasks correspond to different specific abilities. We further introduce two regularizers to increase the representation difference between subtasks and stabilize the training by discouraging agents from frequently changing subtasks, respectively. Empirical results show that LDSA learns reasonable and effective subtask assignment for better collaboration and significantly improves the learning performance on the challenging StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark and Google Research Football.","Thu, 5 May 2022 10:46:16 UTC (1,523 KB)[v2] Fri, 20 May 2022 03:23:10 UTC (1,524 KB)[v3] Fri, 4 Nov 2022 07:53:02 UTC (1,718 KB)"

Baca","Other Computer Science (cs.OH)","Modelling the trajectorial motion of humans along the ground is a foundational task in the quantitative analysis of sports like association football. Most existing models of football player motion have not been validated yet with respect to actual data. One of the reasons for this lack is that performing such a validation is not straightforward, because models of player motion are usually phrased in a way that emphasises possibly reachable positions rather than expected positions. Since positional data of football players typically contains outliers, this data may misrepresent the range of actually reachable positions. This paper proposes a validation routine for trajectorial motion models that measures and optimises the ability of a motion model to accurately predict all possibly reachable positions by favoring the smallest predicted area of reachable positions that encompasses all observed reached positions up to a manually defined threshold. We demonstrate validation and optimisation on four different motion models, assuming (a) motion with constant speed, (b) motion with constant acceleration, (c) motion with constant acceleration with a speed limit, and (d) motion along two segments with constant speed. Our results show that assuming motion with constant speed or constant acceleration without a limit on the achievable speed is particularly inappropriate for an accurate distinction between reachable and unreachable locations. Motion along two segments of constant speed provides by far the highest accuracy among the tested models and serves as an efficient and accurate approximation of real-world player motion.","Thu, 7 Apr 2022 08:34:19 UTC (899 KB)"

Processing football game video presents great challenges such as crowded settings, distorted objects, and imbalanced data for identifying players, especially jersey numbers. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based player tracking system to automatically track players and index their participation per play in American football games. It is a two-stage network design to highlight areas of interest and identify jersey number information with high accuracy. First, we utilize an object detection network, a detection transformer, to tackle the player detection problem in a crowded context. Second, we identify players using jersey number recognition with a secondary convolutional neural network, then synchronize it with a game clock subsystem. Finally, the system outputs a complete log in a database for play indexing. We demonstrate the effectiveness and reliability of player tracking system by analyzing the qualitative and quantitative results on football videos. The proposed system shows great potential for implementation in and analysis of football broadcast video.","Tue, 26 Apr 2022 02:59:03 UTC (4,913 KB)[v2] Tue, 26 Dec 2023 23:22:20 UTC (2,328 KB)"
149,"Graph Neural Network based Agent in Google Research Football","Yizhan Niu, Jinglong Liu, Yuhao Shi, Jiren Zhu","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Deep neural networks (DNN) can approximate value functions or policies for reinforcement learning, which makes the reinforcement learning algorithms more powerful. However, some DNNs, such as convolutional neural networks (CNN), cannot extract enough information or take too long to obtain enough features from the inputs under specific circumstances of reinforcement learning. For example, the input data of Google Research Football, a reinforcement learning environment which trains agents to play football, is the small map of players' locations. The information is contained not only in the coordinates of players, but also in the relationships between different players. CNNs can neither extract enough information nor take too long to train. To address this issue, this paper proposes a deep q-learning network (DQN) with a graph neural network (GNN) as its model. The GNN transforms the input data into a graph which better represents the football players' locations so that it extracts more information of the interactions between different players. With two GNNs to approximate its local and target value functions, this DQN allows players to learn from their experience by using value functions to see the prospective value of each intended action. The proposed model demonstrated the power of GNN in the football game by outperforming other DRL models with significantly fewer steps.","Sat, 23 Apr 2022 21:26:00 UTC (623 KB)"
150,"Clustering of football players based on performance data and aggregated clustering validity indexes","Serhat Akhanli, Christian Hennig","Applications (stat.AP)","We analyse football (soccer) player performance data with mixed type variables from the 2014-15 season of eight European major leagues. We cluster these data based on a tailor-made dissimilarity measure. In order to decide between the many available clustering methods and to choose an appropriate number of clusters, we use the approach by Akhanli and Hennig (2020). This is based on several validation criteria that refer to different desirable characteristics of a clustering. These characteristics are chosen based on the aim of clustering, and this allows to define a suitable validation index as weighted average of calibrated individual indexes measuring the desirable features. We derive two different clusterings. The first one is a partition of the data set into major groups of essentially different players, which can be used for the analysis of a team's composition. The second one divides the data set into many small clusters (with 10 players on average), which can be used for finding players with a very similar profile to a given player. It is discussed in depth what characteristics are desirable for these clusterings. Weighting the criteria for the second clustering is informed by a survey of football experts.","Wed, 20 Apr 2022 21:46:27 UTC (1,433 KB)"
