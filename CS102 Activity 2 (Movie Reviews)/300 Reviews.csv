                This movie and the whole trilogy deserves all the praise it has received.I had been worried about seeing it because of how much Peter Jackson re-wrote ""Two Towers"" and presented scenes that undermined some of Tolkien's fundamental ideas. This time, Jackson followed Tolkien more closely and the worst that can be claimed are sins of omission. It's a real shame we didn't get to see Christopher Lee in this move; he totally rocked in the previous films. Telling us to wait for the ""extended"" version isn't right. Maybe Jackson should have foregone one of the too many endings in ROTK to give Lee some film time. That said, all the elements that worked in the previous movies were absolutely glorious in this film. The one new thing that I would add to so much that has already been written is that big kudos must go to the great Tolkien artists Alan Lee and John Howe whose artistry shaped so much of the imagery from the first moments of FOTR to the final scenes of ROTK. This historic trilogy would not have been the same without them. The LOTR enterprise has clearly been a great labor of love from all who worked on it over the years, and this final installment was a crowning achievement.

                The Return of the King is an impressive film because it wraps up the Lord of the Rings trilogy in a way that is satisfying for both fans of the books and those who have only seen the movies. This finale is a rollercoaster of emotions, with impressive sets, elaborate costumes, and eye-popping visual effects. The Lord of the Rings was already a great novel, but it has now become one of the greatest film trilogies ever made.

                The Return of the King comes to the big screens worldwide in 2003 evoking the most diverse types of feelings: sadness, joy, delight and satisfaction are some of them. After two adaptations that have shocked the world with its grandeur, director Peter Jackson presents fans around the world with a performance worthy of applause and bows certainly will miss and leave an empty feeling in the mind of anyone who likes movies. Peter Jackson had the challenge of overcoming the stigma that the end of trilogies are always inferior and never meet the expectations of fans. Thus, citing some examples, The Matrix Revolutions, also released in 2003, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi and Back to the Future 3. The fear of not overcome the previous growing further because The Two Towers have been a landmark in special effects and maintained the same level of quality The Fellowship of the Ring. Fortunately, Jackson has not only surpassed their predecessors, they created probably the greatest fantasy film in cinema history, an epic beyond compare proportions and practically unattainable.In The Return of the King, the action is raised to four points that will interconnect in a spectacular finale. Frodo, Sam and Gollum are heading toward the mountain of doom. Gandalf and Pippin help in preparing the defense of Minas Tirith, Merry joins the army of the horsemen of Rohan who will prepare for the ultimate battle. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are in search of help that may be decisive in the battle against Sauron. The scenarios and events are magnified and more majestic. The various passages for those who read the books will come to life: Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor, Aragorn entering the Paths of the Dead; battle where Faramir is seriously injured, the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the opening of the Black Gate, the Tower of Cirith Ungol, Mount Doom, the Chambers of Fire, to help the Eagles against Sauron's armies, the destruction of the Ring and the defeat of Sauron, the Return of the King of Gondor with Elvish name Elessar and his marriage to Arwen that preferred to live a mortal life alongside his love, The Grey Havens, etc.The Return of the King, however, has excesses in your script. Probably due to the pace and duration, Jackson decided to remove some passages from The Two Towers and insert them in The Return of the King, further increasing the duration of the latter film, leaving you with 201 min long version released in theaters. Apart from scene to increase the length of the already quite long film differs from other facts book and technically, the film is almost perfect and became the record holder by winning the Oscar 2004, 11 of the 11 nominations received statuettes at the awards, equaling in number of awards only to Titanic (1997) director James Cameron and Ben-Hur ( 1959) director William Wyler, who have the same amount of premiums. Won awards for best art direction, costume design, editing, makeup, soundtrack, original music for the song ""Into the West"", sound, visual effects, adapted screenplay, direction and best film.The visual effects are still tasteful and make a junction between actual filming practically perfect computer-generated. The scene of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, fought outside the walls of Minas Tirith, is the greatest example of this. Probably that's the longest streak of battles ever held in the cinema,The cast can once again have great performances. And when Peter Jackson said in interviews that the first two films were preparing for this end, he was not kidding. Its direction is the major difference and that is what makes movies differentiate themselves from other similar launched later worried only with the battles, and not with the feelings of the characters and their motivations. Again with beautiful general plans, stretches with use of slow motion and camera movements unthinkable, the director explores all too well the natural environment and which was built by art director for the shoot. The New Zealand ties all the stories parallel so that everything can be solved simultaneously. But The Return of the King is not just a fantasy film with effects, and he cares to enlarge tensions, hesitations, internal struggles, motivations of the protagonists involved. The key of this third part is mainly in the hands of Aragorn and Frodo. Aragorn have to return to Gondor and take the place it is right and lead the resistance against the enemy threat, including having to collect a debt from the past. Here it is Frodo, is increasingly tempted by the ring which carries this internal conflict and leads to the last moment when you are about to destroy it.But Jackson increases even more the importance of Sam, showing all his courage and fidelity to the hobbit friend so he can achieve his goal. Jackson still has other moments of pure wisdom and sensitivity amid such scenes of war exhaustive. For example, when Denethor sends Faramir (David Fenham) on a suicide mission, asking then to Pippin sing a song while you eat something. Jackson then makes the viewer watch the scene Squad Faramir being massacred while listening Pippin at the request of Denethor, sings a sad song. The Return of the King is a masterpiece of cinema magnanimous and impassable. Is beyond reproach and is practically a unanimous vote of the seventh art and has everything that an overproduction epoch must have. We have a script respectful of the original work, interpreters' unquestionable quality and revolutionary teams ahead of all technical teams. The film is transgressive, innovative, and not afraid to take over as the definitive work of recognized worldwide work of Tolkien. Is left longing and buy all the extended versions to always have a Middle-earth in our hands to be visited at any time.

                Wow, what a movie! It's not only the best of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, it also is one of the best movies of the past couple of years.""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" is a totally spectacular movie. It has some of the most amazing battle scene's in movie history. The word spectacular isn't good enough to describe it, it's breathtaking, epic and emotional involving. Who didn't wanted to pick up a sword and shield and charge with Aragorn towards a large number of Orcs for honor and glory?Even though the special effects are far from the best ever, Peter Jackson is a master in mixing the special effect with real life action. The use of it never feels overdone and the result is spectacular as well as believable.I think lot's of people were worried after ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" after seeing the battle of Helm's Deep. How was Peter Jackson ever going to top that great battle? Well, with ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" he topped it alright! The battle for Middle Earth is something you've never seen before. Greatest moment was when the riders of Rohan charged, it was really a moment in which you felt the true meaning of fighting and dying with honor. Also great moment during the immensely large battle were the fights against the oliphaunts, just when you thought the battle was over, those large creatures appeared! Really great moment.The characters are possibly at their best in this movie. No characters need introductions anymore and we get to see the deepest of their emotions in this movie, even Gollum's!Still the movie is not really deserving to be third in the top 250 here on IMDb.com. It's also not really deserving all those Oscar's it won. Like all The Lord of the Rings movies, it's great, spectacular and absolutely breathtaking at times but not classic masterpieces in my book.Also the movie is far from flawless. Once again the editing is just poor at times and what was with the ending? Couldn't they just think of one ending? I expected the end credits to start rolling multiple times during the ending but it just went on and on.Despite some of those flaws it still is an excellent movie with some unforgettable battle's sequence's. Truly a wonderful ending for one of the greatest movie trilogies in history.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

                A Blu-ray extended version for almost four and a half hours. The scene of the war is still magnificent. It is Frodo's luck to have a good friend like Sam. Gandalf is still otherworldly and holy. The last part of the play makes my eyes wept. This is the end of the epic blockbuster and an era. But classics will become eternal.

                After finishing my 100th (give or take) time watching the entire trilogy I'd figured a review was long overdue. There are no words for what i feel about this trilogy. It's beyond anything i can explain. The closest word would be perfection, but that doesn't even do it justice.I was 11 when the first movie came out, and i fell in love with the franchise immediately. Everything i did revolved around the fantasy universe as this franchise was the first big thing i truly fell in love with. I have pictures of elves on my walls and dragon statues on my shelfs. I have Sting hanging on my wall and my key chain for my car keys is the One Ring. My wife has the evening star and she wore it at our wedding. Lord of the rings has made me to who i am today and i feel privileged to have such a masterpiece be created in my short span on this earth!I love Fellowship of the Ring and Two Towers, but Return of the King is the final piece that brings everything together. I'm usually a pretty tough guy, and i rarely get emotional but the last hour is hard for me to sit through without shedding a tear. No matter how many times i watch the franchise i always get emotional. ""My friends. You bow to no one!"" gets me every time!The last thing I'd like to ad is that i feel like I'm a part of the journey. I feel sorta empty after watching it. I feel like all of the hobbits when they come back home and drinks their first pints at The Green Dragon. It's one of the movies where i sit through the end credits and just think. This is a good thing. You know a movie is extraordinary if it makes you empty after you've watched it!

                Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of ""Lord of the Rings"" reaches its pinnacle in ""Return of the King."" The stellar cast, mind-blowing special effects and heartbreaking script are all present in the third movie, which is not only the last of the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, but the best.Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are still following the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis) on the path to Mordor, with the increasingly strained Frodo unaware that Gollum is sowing suspicion between the two best friends. By the time he realises his mistake, he's been dragged into the lair of Shelob, a monstrous spider, and then abducted by orcs who want the Ring he carries. Determined to find his friend, Sam heads into an orc citadel...Meanwhile, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) takes Pippin (Billy Boyd) with him to Minas Tirith, after the hobbit has a close encounter with Sauron through a palantir. \Not only is the city under siege, but the Steward Denethor is slowly going insane, even sending his one remaining son, Faramir (David Wenham), on a suicide mission to reclaim a dead city. With Minas Tirith crumbling, Aragorn's (Viggo Mortensen) only hope may to be summon an army of the dead, who will only obey the King of Gondor. But even the dead won't help him if Frodo doesn't destroy the Ring...The ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is one of those once-in-a-lifetime movie experiences. There has never been anything quite like it in movie history, and there probably never will be again. It seems somehow fitting that the book that every other fantasy has to measure up to, has now become a sweeping cinematic triumph that actually stays halfway loyal to the books. Good things come to fans who wait, I guess.Peter Jackson really outdoes himself. You know those battle scenes in ""Two Towers"" and ""Fellowship of the Ring,"" with the swooping camera and thousands of orcs, clashing with men on a gloomy battlefield? In ""Return of the King,"" Jackson surpasses that. There's everything from volcanic eruptions to an invasion of howling ghosts to the attack of the oliphaunts (like elephants, only bigger). Each action scene a shattering ride, and there's no guarantee that all the beloved characters will make it out alive. Some of them don't.But if Jackson manages the epic battles well, he does an even better job with the gentler, quieter moments. The action slows down, and the characters take a moment to support and comfort each other. They cry, they hug, they think about home -- such as Gandalf comforting the frightened Pippin with a description of the afterlife. Jackson and his fellow screenwriters Fran Walsh and Phillippa Boyens throw themselves into the semi-formal language of Tolkien's world, resculpting Tolkien's words into equally rich movie dialogue.Elijah Wood gives an unparallelled performance as Frodo Baggins. Frodo's gradual deterioration is wrenching to watch, and the climactic scene at Mount Doom displays just what the Ring can do to even the pure-hearted hobbit. Sean Astin follows up with his powerful performance as Sam, who is increasingly the ""strong"" hobbit, rather than the follower. The final scenes between these two outstanding actors are beautiful and understated.But all the supporting cast also give powerful performances -- Boyd and Dominic Monaghan put their characters through some intense growing pains, and the ""I'm going to take care of you"" scene is enough to bring tears to your eyes. Mortensen gets more kingly every moment, while Ian McKellen balances action with grandfatherly wisdom. Bernard Hill has a quietly moving final scene, while Miranda Otto makes the despairing Eowyn a strong, kick-butt heroine.Perhaps the most striking thing about ""Return of the King"" is the final fourth of the film. While the ""multiple endings"" may annoy some viewers, it seems somehow right to gently let go of these characters rather than have a sudden, splashy finale. And whether they have a happy or sad ending, Jackson never lets us forget that they all made sacrifices to battle Sauron.""Return of the King"" brings the epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy to a close, and cements Jackson's reputation as a master filmmaker. With the outstanding cast, beautiful scripting and amazing direction, this is the best of the ""Lord"" films -- and that's saying something.

                I've just re-watched The Lord of the Rings trilogy for the 1000th time tonight... nearly 15 years since the Fellowship of the Rings was released... I still haven't seen a movie that's better, nor close, to any of these three films. The casting is perfection as well as the incredible acting by everyone in the movie. I can still watch these movies back to back and not get bored. They are a light to this world and wouldn't be the same without them.I miss the good old LOTR's days. The best movies ever created. The Return of the King was the best way to end a thrilling journey through middle earth!

                Finally, after a series of magical books by J.R.R. Tolkien, and after the first two movies in a series that redefined cinema, ""The Lord of the Rings"" series finally comes to a close, with ""The Return of the King"". I'm so pleased to be saying the following words. This movie is not just the best in this magical series, but it's also mostly one of the greatest movies ever made on screen. The final story picks up where ""The Two Towers"" left off, where Frodo and Sam are still traveling to Mordor, while Gollum might set them in a trap to capture the ring at last. Then, Gandalf and the gang are still trying to defeat the wrath of Sauron, and finally be able to destroy this deadly ring. Thanks to the incredible masterful directing by Peter Jackson, and thousands of artists and technicians, they all help us dig deeper into this magical world that, only at the movies, we can be able to escape to. The performances are just brilliant and electrifying to watch on screen. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin are just brilliant, continuing their roles as Frodo and Sam, and they still have a lot of heart and soul into their on-screen friendship. Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen improves once again with fine and brilliant performances. But out of all that, it's Andy Serkis that should have received a Best Supporting Actor nomination in 2003, for his work as Gollum. Serkis has portrayed such a brilliant character, and the visual enhancements made to create him was all quite super. From an opening flashback involving Smeagol (a.k.a. Gollum) that's super thrilling, to a final setback, Gollum is by far the best character in this movie. Although this movie is set during a long 200 minute run-time, I was just distracted for what this movie had to offer, that I didn't care about how long it was. It has everything you'd expect to see. It's got heartbreak, action, comedy, drama, fantasy, and magic. The special effects are exhilarating, from beginning to end, and it made me wanting for more. The beautiful art direction and costumes made me feel like I escaped to a more beautiful place. The cinematography is challenging in such perfection, and the original score is really with a treat. I also adored the wonderful sound effects, and the memorable film editing. The love stories are touching, the friendship scenes are heartwarming, the fight scenes are groundbreaking, and the finale blends with a perfect mix of heartbreak and hope. I could tell you a thousand reasons why this movie is excellent. This is a movie that loves movies. It's a movie that keeps you wanting for more. All this movie needed was a talented director, a brilliant cast, groundbreaking special effects, incredible art direction, amazing music, and an inspirational storyline. This is such a crowning achievement in cinema. It's one of my all-time favorite movies, and I'm glad this movie won the Best Picture Oscar in 2003. ""LOTR: The Return of the King"", in my review, ""an epic and groundbreaking cinematic masterpiece"".

                The third part in Jackson's trilogy based on the novels written by the great J.R.R Tolkien , picking up shortly after the second one left off . This extraordinary film begins with Frodo (Elijah Wood) , Sam (Sean Astin) along with Gollum/Smeagol (Andy Serkis) continuing the travel towards Mount Doom , the only place where the Ring can be destroyed . Frodo and Sam care the Ring in order to keep it from falling into the hands of its evil creator . Meantime , Gondor is invaded by the Orcs of Mordor and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) ride to Minas Tirith . There rules Denethor (John Noble) , father of the deceased Boromir (Sean Bean) , and Faramir (David Wenham) . While Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) must choose between his two lovers , Eowyn (Miranda Otto) and Arwen(Liv Tyler) . Later on , Aragorn , Legolas (Orlando Jones) , and Gimli (John Rhys Davies) travel to the creepy caves inhabited by the Army of the Dead .This sensational epic adventure is plenty of action , impressive battles , spectacular drama and being pretty entertaining . The movie packs a real sense of wonder and stimulating action set pieces illuminating the full-blown feats of the various protagonists and winding up in overlong battles and a stunning finale . It contains incredible array of technical visual effects by Weta Digital and Weta Workship , among others companies . Sensational cinematography by Andrew Lesnie and spectacular as well as sensitive musical score by Howard Shore , winning deservedly Academy Award . Beautifully realized set design with phenomenal production values . The film provides enough amusement during the three and half hour and stays closer to the novel than any of the former adaptations -mostly animated and in low budget- such as the mediocre effort by Ralph Baski . The motion picture will appeal to Tolkien followers as the neophyte who didn't have seen the previous parts and those unfamiliar with the lengthy literary work . Magnificent direction by Peter Jackson bringing stunningly the imaginary world and mythology of Tolkien to life .

                The Return of the King is the best movie ever made to the best trilogy ever done. This movie deserved the eleven Oscars it got including the Editing. Without the editing, this movie would've been over four hours long. Even though this movie is about three and a half hours, it dies not feel like it. The scenes are intense and can tend to be emotional. Gollum is the show-stealer again. As the ring is taking Frodo away from strength, Gollum uses that to get the ring back eventually and drive Sam away. It was kind of sad to see Gollum die along with the Ring in the fires of Mt.Doom. Aragorn deserves to be king of Gondor. He was amazing in this movie(played by Viggo Mortensen). I am glad that Legolas and Gimli were used for comedy. With all the drama and action, there needs to be a bit of comedy before the action overwhelms the movie. The acting is perfect. I liked most of the characters. It was sad when Theoden died. He was great in this series. The music by Howard Shore is even better. You can hear some Celtic tunes during some scenes. I loved the song, ""Into The West"" by Annie Lennox. The effects and the CGI is excellent especially during the battle scenes towards the end. Peter Jackson really put his name into the record books. This is the best fantasy epic, in fact the best movie of all time. I rate this movie 15/10(if the rating system went any higher).

                Before Peter Jackson's adaptation of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, the world of high fantasy has not been particularly well-served by cinema. The genre was not even really taken seriously in literature until the 1960s. During the 80s, there was a fad for fantasy movies, but while most of these looked nice and were good enough fun, none of them really had magnificence (although the 1981 Excalibur movie comes pretty close). It was not until the first decade of the 20th century that we saw fantasy cinema's rather delayed coming-of-age.As with the first two movies in the trilogy the transition from novel to screenplay is exceptional. There's a lot more action and a lot less dialogue in this one, and yet the plot is still clear and the narrative never feels repetitive. The idea of binding the various story lines together in time – such as when the Witch-King arises near Frodo and Sam, but the tower of green light is seen miles away by Pippin – are great for building up the tension. They also really help to establish this vision of Middle Earth as a real place with vast dimensions.And again Jackson proves himself to be an action director with that little extra flair of intelligence. At first glance his work seems very much aimed at those with short attention spans, but there is so much loaded into each and every shot, the camera following an orc as he falls to the ground, or coming to rest upon a woman holding a baby as panic erupts in the city. His horror-tinged imagining of certain scenes is truly unnerving.There is some all-round improved acting in this instalment. Perhaps the years wrapped up in the production were taking the necessary toll on the cast. There are some truly heartfelt moments from Bernard Hill and a wonderfully spirited turn from Miranda Otto. For me, Billy Boyd always stood out as the finest of the hobbit performers, and this is the movie where he comes to the forefront, demonstrating great dignity and emotion. The best performance however, as previously, belongs to Ian McKellen as Gandalf. There's something strangely knowing in his final scene.One of the unfortunate things about The Return of the King is that it suffers worse than the first two movies from a lack of dignity at certain times. The CGI Gollum is too cutesy and it's hard to believe in him as an antagonist, although funnily enough the glimpse we get of partly-transformed Smeagol biting into a fish with Andy Serkis in prosthetics would have been perfect for the whole thing. Some of the most serious bits become silly. I remember laughing out loud in the cinema when Gandalf says ""So passes Denethor"" when the man is still pathetically running around in flames.But by-and-large, this is an exceptional production, with its most outstanding touches in the way the whole thing has been put together. When the beacons are lit stretching a line across a mountain range, it's done in such a smooth, rhythmic way we are simultaneously impressed by the immense scale, the beauty of the landscape and the sheer brilliance of it as a means of communication. When Pippin's haunting song continues in the background as the men of Gondor ride off to their doom, we feel the depth of what is going on in a way the images alone could not impart. This is the kind of thinking you don't see in those numerous 80s fantasy movies, or in sci-fi's big trilogy, Star Wars. The Lord of the Rings movies put us right within both the excitement and the sadness of the story, for me with greater weight than Tolkien himself achieved. It elevates this above being merely another CGI action flick and grants the fantasy genre a status and stature it has never enjoyed before.

                The conclusion of the best movie of fantasy and adventure ever made is in the same level of the other two parts of this splendid story. The journey of Frodo Baggins and his friends in this movie is again outstanding, stunning, a masterpiece. I believe there is nothing else to be said about this fantastic movie. The eleven Oscars, the IMDB User rating of 9,0 with 62,820 votes and the 2,219 reviews are sufficient. I just want to record my enthusiasm with such a film. Unfortunately the same did not happen with the sequence of Matrix, where the first film was excellent, but the sequences were very disappointing. My vote is ten. Title (Brazil): `O Senhor dos Anéis: O Retorno do Rei' (`Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, The')

                As I'm writing this I can't quite believe that this was 20 years ago. I've seen these three films a gazillion times and regularity watch them at least once a year. The Two Towers is my favourite and when Retun came out I didn't like the ending... mostly because I think I was just sad to realise it was all over but also because the last half hour feels like it has about three endings and keels going. But now regard it as pure perfection. I don't think a film series can be beaten for music, script or acting. It's masterful in all three. I think we can forgive Jackson for the few directing failings along the way, the. Man had a lot on his plate lol. But seriously I'll be watching these films forever. Simply The GOAT. If you don't love these movies then you seriously have no soul. And if you've read the books you'll know that it was a near impossibly task to make them at all. Jackson has pulled of the seemingly impossible.

                Lord of the rings return of the king, is breathtaking. It brought the book to life, and made it better. It was super lengthy, but I honestly liked it that way. It means it had time for a lot of epic events, and the battles could be longer. It also made it more emotional, dragging out the ending, it wrapped up well. It is the best movie I have seen in a few months. I had already seen it before 5 years ago, and I don't remember loving it. So my expectations weren't that high, but it was amazing. I guess the movie is just a bit sophisticated for an 8 year old, but brilliant for a 13 year old. At times the C. G. I was pretty bad, but the action, the cast, the story, the emotion, the scenery, the acting, and the charisma of Pippin, and Gollum were perfect.

"20"," The Greatest Film Trilogy of All Time
","CinemaClown","5 October 2013",NA,"
                Every tale embarks us on a new journey, every journey eventually comes to its inevitable end. As for The Lord of the Rings, The Fellowship of the Ring turned out to be a genre-defining classic. The Two Towers somehow raised the bar to an even higher level. And although it did seem near- impossible for The Return of the King to triumph over such towering expectations but against all odds, this final journey of Middle-Earth delivers everything to bring J.R.R. Tolkien's legendary saga to an epic & magnificent conclusion.The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is the culmination of the wonderful journey we embarked on with The Fellowship of the Ring & picks up the story right from where it was left off in The Two Towers. The story finds Frodo & Sam continuing their quest towards Mount Doom in order to destroy the One Ring while the rest of the fellowship prepares for their final battle as the dark lord Sauron turns his eye on Gondor. But in the end, it all comes down to Frodo & the One Ring to decide the final fate of Middle- Earth.Directed by Peter Jackson, this remains his finest directional achievement & The Lord of the Rings as a whole is certainly his magnum opus. Making all films in a trilogy succeed on every scale is no mere achievement but to make the next instalment work better than its predecessor two times in a row is even rarer. And yet, Jackson manages to accomplish exactly that with his sweeping cinematic vision, stunning eye for detail & in-depth knowledge of balancing emotional storytelling with large-scale action entertainment.The screenplay is cleverly adapted from the source material as many right choices were made in the decision of what to include & what to leave out from the final script. Fran Walsh also tries her hand at direction as the opening prologue is her creation. Being the final film in the trilogy, there's a sense of urgency in this chapter but it still ties up all the loose ends appropriately, gives proper farewells to its characters & delivers a high-quality entertainment of such epic proportions that fans couldn't have asked for a better finale.Coming to the technical aspects, Production design adds even more amazing & meticulously detailed sets to its story, the dazzling cinematography further magnifies the visual presentation to make the cinematic experience even more magical and Howard Shore's epic score is filled with tracks that are truly imposing, beautiful & further expand the domain of its predecessors as the soundtrack of The Lord of the Rings remains the greatest work of his illustrious career.VFX is once again its most groundbreaking feat, however, this time it isn't a slight advancement but a pretty huge leap. Everything that made its brief appearance in the first two chapters is fully explored in this finale plus the length, scope & magnitude of battle sequences it offers is second to none. Also, with better rendering of its CGI characters & stunning level of craftsmanship in costumes, make-up & sound, The Return of the King sets a new benchmark for visuals in cinema that remains unequaled, as of today, in the scope of how much it contributed to the film's art while elevating the whole story.Despite running at 201 minutes, there were many things which got omitted from the theatrical cut & that's why the extended edition is more recommended. Also, many happen to criticize the last 45 minutes it takes to finally end but if you ever watch The Lord of the Rings in one sitting, then it'll make perfect sense to you because not only is it a reasonably enough time to recover the audience from what is an emotionally draining experience but also provides proper farewells that each one of its characters deserved.Coming to the performances, The Fellowship of the Ring & The Two Towers introduced almost all characters we needed to be acquainted with & The Return of the King simply brings their arcs to completion. Unlike the previous two films in which Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) & Gollum (Andy Serkis) turned out to be the most impressive characters, respectively, there is no single dominating performance in this chapter as its entire cast puts up a more mature on-screen portrayal of their respective characters & never really leaves anything major to complain about.J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings is unanimously hailed by critics & readers alike as the greatest fantasy novel ever written & a milestone in the works of literature. And it's amazing that its film adaptation follows the same route in the world of cinema. It did catapult Peter Jackson into the big leagues of Hollywood while also setting up Weta Digital as one of the foremost VFX studios on the planet but where it made its biggest impact is on cinema itself for it changed everything there ever was about epic & fantasy filmmaking, is one of the most important films of the modern era & a landmark moment in the annals of cinema.On an overall scale, The Return of the King is more than just a fitting conclusion to The Lord of the Rings. It triumphs as one of the greatest sequels ever made but along with The Fellowship of the Ring & The Two Towers, it also makes up for cinema's greatest motion picture trilogy that will not soon, if ever, find its equal. An unprecedented achievement in the world of filmmaking that's epic in every sense of the word, The Lord of the Rings, in some ways, is to cinema what its source material was to literature & it is destined to remain a standard by which all future film trilogies will be measured for decades to come.

                In terms of the individual installments of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings epic trilogy, Return of the King may actually be my least favorite (if only by a hair). The character-building isn't needed, like in Fellowship, and the battles are no better than those in Two Towers. The film's length (even the 3.5 hour theatrical cut) borders on prohibitive. Yet, it remains a slam-dunk 10/10 effort. The reason? The emotional payoffs to all the threads set up in those previous two installments.For a very basic overview, Return of the King sees the two primary plots of the trilogy reach their apex:-Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin), & Gollum/Smeagle (Andy Serkis) finally reach Mordor--but not before a significant detour along the way and a gut-wrenching decision at the journey's end.-Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) reclaims his kingly birthright and leads the denizens of Middle Earth in a final battle with Sauron's minions. Along for the ride again are feisty dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) the marksman Elf, and hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) & Pippin (Billy Boyd) doing the best they can to contribute to the cause.The overall hallmark of this concluding chapter is the way in which it pays off all the threads set up in the previous two. This one doesn't have to break new ground, and largely doesn't. It just needs to put an amen to perhaps the most incredible book-to-film adaptation of all-time, which it accomplishes with aplomb. What Jackson really understands is how much of a journey the audience has taken alongside the famous fantasy characters (especially true if experienced during the three-year theatrical run). The end of their journey is also the end of ""ours"", in other words.Specifically notable here is the last half hour or so of runtime, where the visuals, music, direction, & acting meld together to create some of the most emotionally rousing scenes of the whole trilogy. I have yet to behold these moments without a tear being shed.Overall, then, Return of the King is a regal ending to Jackson's masterful vision. It may not break much cinematic new ground, but it doesn't have too. It simply does its job: pay off all the previously-established action, adventure, drama, humor, and (most of all) heart.

Masterpiece and best movie that won Oscar after the Godfather. I can't believe that the Academy recognized this masterpiece and gave it an Oscar. Performances are out of this world and Serkis is again amazing as Smeagol/Gollum. The end is heartbreaking and soundtrack is perfect the whole time. Clean sweep 11/11 Oscars is the best thing that ever happend to Oscars. They should remember that days and start giving Oscars for best picture to films that actually deserved Oscar( angry Blade runner 2049 fan).

                It all comes down to this. The humans and hobbits now have their final battles to fight with the forces of evil. I can't actually say anything about ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" that does it justice, except to say that it is a great movie in the true sense of the word. Everything that we've awaited in life is summed up in this piece of cinematic history. Every one of the cast members does a masterful job. Therefore, it makes sense that this movie was nominated for 11 Oscars including Best Picture, and won EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. ""LOTR: TROTK"" is THE movie that you have to see to believe. It is everything that we like about movies.

                The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003) Extended Edition is a movie in my DVD collection that my daughter and I recently watched together on HBOMAX. The storyline follows our heroes marching to their doom in hopes of saving Middle Earth. Sam and Frodo continue slithering through the mountains in hopes of destroying the ring with Gollum. Meanwhile, Aragon and friends prepare to stand off against Sauron's army in hopes of distracting them long enough for Frodo to slip by then and destroy the ring. Likelihood for success is low but hope is high...This movie is directed by Peter Jackson (Bad Taste) and stars Elijah Wood (The Faculty), Viggo Mortensen (Hidalgo), Ian McKellen (Gods and Monsters), Orlando Bloom (Pirates of the Caribbean), Sean Astin (The Goonies), Cate Blanchett (The Aviator) and Liv Tyler (Armageddon).There is nothing that isn't perfect about this movie except you never want it to end. The settings are so beautiful and well filmed. The cast is perfectly selected and demonstrate both their desperation and their will to push forward. The inner struggles within every character is perfectly depicted. The attire, props and use of CGI to create both magic and monsters was awesome. The battle scenes are epic and the ending is absolutely amazing and closes the trilogy perfectly.Overall this is the greatest fantasy series ever created that is an absolute must see. I would score this a strong 10/10 and consider it an absolute must see.

                The 3rd and final film of the LotR series. This one looses nothing it only continues the story. Picks up right where ""Two Towers"" leaves off. Grittier story, more foe & dirtier grittier battles - the worst is yet to come... The Witch King of Angmar, Lord of the Nazgul.This film has an air of horror to it... more frightening than the first two films. In the end, you whistle is wet for more.A wicked film well worth watching. High fantasy fans as well as those who love a lot of action and adventure will enjoy watching this one for the first time or again and again.10/10

"28"," An epic masterpiece made even better in its extended form

                In 2003, Lord of the Rings- Return of the King won top honors at nearly every major Award ceremony, and set a new record for box-office receipts, one that would stand for six years. It blew audiences away with its epic storytelling and scale, surpassing even the previous two entries in the trilogy. It was a truly great film. And now with the extended version, it's even better than before.The reason why Return of the King, is so great is threefold. First, it's based on one of the twentieth century's greatest works of literature. Secondly, director Peter Jackson has remained true to source material, leaving as much as possible intact. And lastly, this project saw a near unprecedented infusion of talent and money. From the director, to the extremely large cast, to the effects wizards at WETA, everyone knew what they were doing and gave it their very best. Nothing was held back, no expense spared, and no detail overlooked, and the result is pure awesomeness.One of Tolkien's greatest talents as a writer was his ability to fill his worlds with a host of distinct, interesting characters, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and struggles. Jackson has included nearly all, and through them explores myriad themes. In Aragorn (Vigo Mortenson) we see a man who overcome his self-doubt and accept the mantle of greatness that he was meant to wear. He's also the embodiment of true courage, being brave or perhaps crazy enough to pick up the seeing stone and tell Sauron, ""Here I am, come and get me.""In Frodo (Elijah Wood) the story explores how even the most ordinary of people can accomplish great things, but also how even the purest can be tempted by power and corrupted by evil. One figure who cannot be corrupted however is Samwise Gamgee, who represents perhaps the ultimate example of friendship and loyalty, sharing every hardship, remaining ever vigilant against Gollum's treachery and the ring's corruption, and braving a giant spider and a fortress of orcs to rescue his friend, even after he had turned on him.Even the relatively minor Characters are well drawn and add to the story. Take Pippin and Merry. They're just a couple of goof-offs, the friends who are just along for the ride. But before the story is done, both will play important roles in the greatest battle of the age. Aeowen for her part embodies both duty to one's people and the the pain of unrequited love. And Legalos and Gimli, though largely relegated to sidekick duty, still show how friendship can transcend racial boundaries and old grudges.But the most interesting character of all must surely be Gollum. Twisted physically and mentally, and with a severe case of split personality, he hates his very existence, and he hates the Ring for what it's done to him, but he desires to possess it even more. He's like a schizoid drug addict- a violent yet often hilarious schizoid drug addict. It's amazing how quickly he can go from playful and comical to pure venom. And no-one does a more unsettling conversation with himself. He's murderous, he's repulsive, he's pitiful, and he's one of the most interesting characters in twentieth century literature.Of course this isn't all internal struggles and character development; it's an epic in the class of The Ten Commandments or Gone with the Wind, but with lots more fighting. And what fighting it is! The combat scenes capture the full intensity and brutality of medieval warfare, of pounding clubs and maces, bodies impaled with spears and arrows, or crushed beneath catapult stones (Within the bounds of PG-13). Yet there's also is the precision, even beauty, of Aragorn's swordsmanship, and Legelos's skill with the bow, their ability to fell an enemy with every swing of the sword or release of an arrow. And then there's the sheer scale of it all. The climactic battle of Pelenor Fields is the largest ever filmed, with dozens of siege engines, more than two-hundred thousand orcs, and a charge by six thousand horsemen. There are few sights that can surpass six thousand armored cavalrymen at full charge, but a counter charge by a line of mumukhiel is surely one of them. Add the piercing shrieks of fell beasts and an army of vengeful dead and you have perhaps the greatest spectacle ever to grace the screen. This may seem hyperbole, or even heretical, but Cecil B. Demile has nothing on Peter Jackson. I'm also highly impressed with the effects and technical aspects of this movie. The set pieces are among the largest and grandest I've seen, and the models have a nearly unprecedented attention to detail. And there are thousands of weapons, orc masks, and suits of armor, all beautifully – or gruesomely- done. Few projects can equal this one in the costume and make-up departments. New Zealand's Weta Workshop might just be the new Industrial Light and Magic.Now obviously all this was already present in the original version. So you may ask if this new version is worth paying to see, especially if you already have the original. My answer: absolutely. There's more humor, exemplified by a side-splitting drinking contest, and more character development, especially with Faramir and Denathor. And there's lots more action, including Gandalf's encounter with the Witch King, a longer fight scene with Gollum, and far more material with the dead men of Dun-Harrow. Jackson has also included important vignettes from the book like the House of Healing scene and negotiations with the Mouth of Sauron. And I particularly enjoyed Christopher Lee's death scene near the beginning.Bottom line, Lord of the Rings, Return of the King is one of the grandest, most exciting, and most inspiring movies you'll ever witness. Try as I might, I can find no fault with it. You owe it to yourself to see this movie, especially in its new and improved state.

                It's just incredible how well Return of the King wraps up the overall Lord of the Rings trilogy. Things expand and branch off in wild directions in The Two Towers, likely making first-time viewers pessimistic it could all come together. But come together it most certainly does, with The Return of the King delivering spectacle, emotion, and large-scale action that few other blockbusters have come close to equaling in the 20 years since its release.Instead of gushing endlessly about things other people have already gushed about (I agree with all the positive things anyone has said), all I can really add is that the extended editions made me love The Return of the King even more. Even though the theatrical version is still about 200 minutes long, numerous great scenes didn't make the cut. Seeing them back in for a final installment that now spans 4+ hours really makes everything gel better. It made a great film into a fantastic one.I used to feel like the various endings of The Return of the King took too long. After watching all three movies as effectively one movie - and doing all the extended versions in one go to boot - the ending feels just as well-paced as the rest of the movie. All the scenes in the epilogue feel earned and truly emotional. The longer journey spent with these characters seems to make all the difference, and I feel like generally speaking, the extended versions are probably superior overall (though there's a scene or two here and there that feels superfluous for sure).Anyway, The Return of the King is fantastic. The whole trilogy is fantastic. I don't know how Peter Jackson and everyone else made such a big trilogy that all works so well. It holds up after 20+ years, and I'm starting to wonder whether it will ever even age at this point.

                This is the final movie in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and certainly doesn't disappoint like some other trilogies *coughMatrixcough*. The three films had their principal shooting all done at the same time, which lowers their overall costs and keeps a good sense of continuity for the films.The special effects, first of all, are excellent. While there's a few little things (a reversed shot with smoke flowing back into chimneys and occasional lighting that's a bit off), by and large they're excellent. The most impressive thing about them is the sheer scale. This isn't a small or simple scene; it often includes thousands of digital characters combined with filmed actors and action, sweeping landscapes, and dozens of things happening at once. This is a good reason to see it in theatres; even on DVD, there's little details that you can only catch when it's on a massive screen.The filming is good, although there are a few evidences of digital smoothing and cutting that can nag at the mind and eyes of a picky movie-goer. There are a few interesting shots, but most are fairly plain and straight on, getting the point across without being dazzling. New Zealand's landscapes provide a great backdrop for everything going on, and there really are some beautiful places, especially up in the mountains. I hear land prices are quite good, what with the orcs warring and everything, so you may want to look into real estate purchases now.Sound has been said to make 75% of the emotional impact of any production. This is a loud 75%. All the sound effects are very well pulled off, sound appropriate, and are generally loud. The Nazgul screeching was bordering on painful, but in a good way. Most everything has a distinct sound, and it's rare that anything feels out of place. In some of the battles, the roof of the theatre was shaking. The soundtrack fits the movie well, and Howard Shore has done an excellent job, as with the last two films in the series.Performances all around were good, but Sean Astin as Sam and Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn really dominated the film. They performed their roles perfectly, and came away giving a good picture of the characters. Elijah Wood seemed to be stuck with the same terrified expression on his face through most of the movie, almost Max Payne-style, and it grew old quickly. Ian McKellen, the ever-wise white wizard, had a fair bit of dialogue which he delivered well; my only complaint is he had too much in the way of wistful sayings leading to scene changes. Orlando Bloom, favorite of young teenage girls everywhere, had a few more action sequences (which got cheers from the aforementioned girls) which were quite well pulled off, but his acting wasn't much tested by this film. John Rhys-Davies continued with Gimli's joking performance; he's really too amusing to take seriously, but does a good job at it.For the old Tolkien fans, this movie stays quite close to the book, although they did have to omit some portions, most notably the taking and retaking of the Shire and the time spent in the Halls of Healing in Minas Tirith. Hopefully some of this will show up in the Extended Edition on DVD. Shelob's attack was left until this film, and much of the time spent in Mordor was shortened for the sake of pacing, and it was a good decision.My favorite scene would have to be the battle at Minas Tirith. The incredible scope of the battle, with the special effects, sounds, and many close-ups of pieces of the action, make for an exciting scene. The visual effects especially are stunning; the 'oliphaunts' play a big part in the action, and they're entirely created by computer. There's also some wide shots with tens of thousands of digital characters marching on the field of battle, and even the individual actions have the masses warring as a backdrop. It's worth your movie-going dollar simply to watch this on a large screen. It was also intermingled with some smaller events inside Minas Tirith, so it's not pure battle for the whole of the scene, and it keeps it from being dreary or heavy-handed.Overall, this is a movie well worth watching, and even paying to see in a theatre. I'd recommend against bringing small children, as there are some scary images, and they'd also be a distraction during the final movie in what will probably remain the series of the decade. Not a particularly great date movie, either...this is a real, bring-your-friends big movie. Five out of five decapitated orcs (and trust me, there were a lot more than that).

                Return of the king is everything it needed to be and more. It concludes the franchise on a very satisfying note and fleshed out our characters even more than in past movies.The conclusion to to this trilogy gives us the best character development in the series. In this film we get to see the relationship between Frodo and Sam dwindle because of gollum's plan to steal the ring. Gollum gets a great scene at the beginning of this movie where we learn how he got the ring. This scene is very important because the ring is much more at the center of gollums story then in the two towers.We also get a lot more of pippens character in this one. Pippen is placed alongside Gandalf as they try to convince the Denethor who is the current ruler of Gondor to call for help. Denethor is the definition of a bad guy, he has very little fatherly aspects to him and it shows from his interactions with faramir. Denethor is very opposed to Aragorn becoming king and would rather see the kingdom fall then have aragorn rule it.We also get to see a bit more development in merrys character as we see him wanting to fight alongside his friends.The battle of Gondor is amazing and has some amazing cinematography. It was great to see the swing of power in this battle. You'd see moments where the forces of Mordor were clearly in control but then the power shifted quickly toward the forces of men.Aragorn completes his journey to become king and viggo mortensen does an amazing job again as this character. Aragorn proves that he is the king by recruiting the ghost army that would ultimately win the battle for them.The music is just as beautiful as in past movies.The end of this movie is extremely satisfying we get to see the hobbits return to the shire and Aragorn assume his role as king. But we also get to see Frodo and Gandalf head onto a new adventure leaving middle earth in a very emotional conclusion.The return of the king fires on all cylinders and caps off a phenomenal movie trilogy. With more character development, quality music and great cinematography this movie is a masterpiece.10/10.

                Well, in the LOTR book, the noble elves never had those pinpointed ears, and the death of Saruman was not like a deleted scene in the DVD version, and then there was not the feat of Legolas of killing an elephant so easily, and then Sam never held Frodo hanging on a cliff There are many points of bitter criticism of the film, and many are true. But do they ever undermine the sheer pleasure of watching and watching again this feast of the film? No, they will never do. The siege of Minas Tirith is great and tragically realistic every new time. The final battle near Mordor is epic regardless how many times you saw that. The brilliant array of talents of Weaving, Mortensen, Wood, Tyler, Serkis, Urban, Wenham, Astin or any other is never vapid or losing taste. The film has stood the test of time, and any time you see the Sauron fall, you feel elation, pride, joy and great triumph. The Good has won again, and even with so many tragic deaths and losses and ruins, it will reign for ever and ever. The final scene of the film, with the parting of Bilbo and Frodo together with the great elves and Gandalf will always make us cry and the final song will make us breathe deep and swallow tears, for this is a noble sorrow and noble sorrow this film has to awake in us. Many films may be made on the eternal novel of Mr. Tolkien, but this epic will stand in our memory eternally. The road goes ever on.

                Spoilers herein.This raises the bar on production values, as it certainly is competently made, say, compared to the `Star Wars' stuff. It seems oddly paced, lacking a rhythm, and more importantly lacking the patina of magic that colored the first two. In fact, everything seems brighter this time out.Unlike the battle of the second, they have decided to not have any movie jokes, like the surfer/warrior who winks at the camera. But there is still a variety in tone from place to place as if different directors were involved. I suppose that's true.I remarked on the earlier films that they innovated primarily in how they use the vertical dimension. This third film is even more competent and extreme in that regard. They knew it was a discriminator and exploited it. Unfortunately, the towers and cities and mountain gates all have an unnatural sameness to them, they are photographed with huge vertical sweeps. Even the first ending where everyone bows to the hobbits and there is the obligatory `helicopter' shot, it goes shockingly far beyond what one expects. The way it pulls back fast and swoops reminds that we are used to an eye that is constrained by the aerodynamics of light helicopters.Not so here. When this is considered in hindsight, I'm pretty sure that the high production values won't be noticed; that all the effects and conventions here  especially the battle scenes  will be seen as borrowed, all except for the exhilarating use of height. That's worth watching. Magic of its own.That magic is enough to carry this project for me. It is clearly Jackson's intent to move his camera in great vertical arcs, usually in ways that no physical camera could. That gives us a fantastic eye. Just a few hours later, I saw `The Lion King' again and noticed that although they were never constrained by physics, they always moved the `camera' in ways we have seen in ordinary `real' films. That's because `Lion' wanted to look real while `Return' wanted to seem ultrareal.Ian McKellen has always puzzled me, he's sort of a working man's John Gielgud, an engineer of the spoken word. Here, he stoops to Alec Guiness' role. A sad way to cap a career.Ted's Evaluation: 3 of 3  Worth watching

                Even after the second installment's grand success, I was still afraid that it will fail. The trailer was brilliant and promised a thousands things to come. And then in the next 3 and a half hours, I was proved wrong!This was the best conclusion to a great trilogy. I never imagined that they could make it bigger and better than the last two. The previous movies were just picnic. Not only the action sequences but also the emotions run high. The battle scenes were really great. But I was more concerned about the people we knew from the last two films who were in it. You really get that feeling of ""The Return"". Unlike the first two, this movie is stylish. The elements are more elegant, the story more bold, the score more experienced and bold and the dangers more troublesome. As Frodo and Sam march towards Mount Doom, the movie gets more darker and hope really seems to fade away. One thing I learned in this movie is: Never give up. No matter what happens you have to finish the task because your cause is important. For me and all the LOTR fans, this is not a movie. What we thought of as an action movie-of-the-week turned out to be an important lesson on hope, friendship, conquering your fears and love. It's a cinematic achievement that will never be defeated. This really is the king of all movies and the 11 golden statues prove it. Go for it (Only if you have seen the first two movies) 10/10

                The Return of the King is the third and final film in the Lord of the Rings saga. Peter Jackson's portrayal of the film is a masterpiece in an already stunning trilogy. ROTK is an epic tale of sacrifice, courage, and friendship. Frodo and Sam's journey to Mount Doom is scary and filled with heart breaking moments of triumph and defeat. Elijah Woods once again portrays Frodo wonderfully as well as Sean Astin. The rest of the fellowship are very good in all of their scenes, especially Viggo Mortenson and Ian McKellan as Gandalf. Visually the cities and battles are simply fantastic and very realistic. This has been a long journey of film starting with the Fellowship 2 years ago and now it has ended wonderfully.

                I started re-watching The Lord of the Rings trilogy few days ago. Today i saw Return of the King, and i gotta say it's the best of the trilogy. The whole trilogy is perfect, not a single flaw. I can never get bored of these movies. Return of the king is an absolute masterpiece. Incredible job by everyone in the cast and crew.Fellowship of the Ring is the perfect start. The Two Towers is the perfect continuation. The Return of the King is the perfect ending to the trilogy. What a thrilling journey!

                The journey comes to an end. For me the final installment ensures that the Lord of the Rings replaces Star Wars as my favourite fantasy movie franchise. In time the film will look dated, but the story and characterisation far surpass that of Star Wars. The Empire Strikes Back is the only one of the Star Wars films that is in the same league as LOR.As with Two Towers, the Return of the King doesn't recap the story so far, so don't even think of seeing this film if you're unfamiliar with the story. It starts with a flashback to Smeagol and means Andy Serkis gets to appear on the finished print. Frodo, Sam and Smeagol then continue on their quest, whilst the remaining members of the fellowship are briefly reunited at Isengard before taking different paths to Minas Tirith.The action is unrelenting and most people will not notice the running time is over 3 hours. As with the previous films the combination of sets, models and cgi brings middle earth to life.I suspect quite a few of the performers will be in with a chance of Oscar recognition. Miranda Otto is the stand out performer and is outstanding as Eowyn and surely deserves the Best Supporting Actress honour. I'm sure that Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, and Orlando Bloom will all have their supporters for acting honours and rightly so, as they all put in fine performances. I'm not sure whether Andy Serkis is elligable, but I suspect the success of Smeagol/Gollum owes as much to him as the animators. Bernhard Hill should also be in with a shout for recognition for his performance as King Theoden. My guess is that it'll miss out on the acting awards with the exception of Miranda Otto. It's absolutely certain to take Best Director, Best Picture and a string of technical awards though. My guess is that it will be nominated for about 12 categories and take 8 gongs.Return of the King isn't flawless however. Saruman was cut entirely from the theatrical release of the film. We therefore missed out on the final face off between Gandalf and Saruman at Isengard. This was certainly filmed and will no doubt be on the extended edition. When the Hobbits return to the Shire it looks remarkably like when they left. No sign that Saruman has arrived back before them and taken over. In the book Merry, Pippin, Sam and Frodo help rally the rest of the Hobbits to retake the Shire, but at some cost to both the hobbits and the environment. Merry, Pippin and Sam become heros to the rest of the hobbits who are largely unaware of Frodo's adventure and exploits. I'm not sure if any of this was shot, but it would be a welcome addition to the extended addition. Personally I would have followed Tolkien and got rid of 7 minutes of Arwen footage and kept Saruman in. Bearing in mind Christopher Lee's passion for the trilogy it is also sad to see him removed from the final episode. I'm quite sure Peter Jackson must have had a few sleepless nights over that decision.If Saruman's exclusion was the biggest blunder of the film, Gimli's consignment to comic interlude was also a bit disappointing. I'm not against a bit of light hearted relief every so often, especially in such a long film, but it seemed that every time Gimli appeared on screen it was for light entertainment. The ""That still only counts as one"" line to Legolas was very funny though.Despite these gripes Peter Jackson can certainly be very proud of the Lord of the Rings. Very few people thought it possible to do justice to the book. He has crafted a film that many people will enjoy for many years.

                One of the best movies I have ever seen!! I recently revisited the Lord of the rings movies and this was the best of the three. The movie looks spectacular and the atmosphere is awesome. Peter Jackson did a brilliant job with these movies and this one is no different. Even to this day people remember this film and it truly is one of cinema's greatest movies of all time. It will go down as one of movies greatest trilogy and it will always stay close to mine and millions of peoples hearts.The acting is superb and the battles and action sequences are beyond comparison. The last battle and final minutes of the film are also really moving.BEST MOVIE EVERRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                In Return of the King - which follows the book (that I have not read, though heard what is in it that is not in the film) as close if not closer than the past two - co-writer/co-producer/director Peter Jackson brings Tolkien's grand tale of the quest to destroy the ring to an end.  The story strands follow along the similar linear paths of the others, and it is done so with an equal worth in entertainment.  Frodo, Sam and Gollum's path to Mordor unfolds as almost something of a love triangle for the ring; Merry and Pippen follow their own tales towards the great battle; Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and all the dwellers of middle earth prepare for the swarm of the terrors of Sauron.  There is much praise that should be given to Jackson and his crew/cast on not just the worth of Return of the King, but to what is now the entire saga of the Lord of the Rings as a whole.  Though the film does carry quite a load to it (at three hours and twenty-one minutes it's the longest of the three in theatrical form, and it definitely does go on at least ten to fifteen minutes longer than it should), and expands and deflates on the details of some characters (i.e. Saruman is nowhere in sight in this version, while Arwen gets more than what is from the original work), there are plenty of rousing scenes and sequences, terrific battles, and a grasp on the visual effects as a whole that don't let up.  In all, ROTK is on the level with Fellowship and Two Towers, making the parts as good as the whole. This is something that only several other filmmakers can make a claim to, that one film does not bring on a let down from the expectations that preceded it.  It's the kind of film I'll want to see again, however it would be very difficult to sit through it in one place.  Grade: A (both as a picture in and of itself, and overall on the three epics combined)

                The 2003 conclusion to the ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is a tour de force. This is by all accounts the best movie in the entire trilogy.Why? Well, because the characters are already well-established and painted out on the screen by now, and the storyline is all chalked up. So everything was pitched for a homerun, and Peter Jackson did just that with ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"".There is such an abundance of action in the movie that you just lean back and enjoy the ride. The battle scenes are massive and well-choreographed, and at times it even feels like you are there on the battlefield amidst men, hobbits and orcs yourself.Needless to say that the sets, props and costumes are amazing here, just as they were in the previous two movies.The performances of the cast were good, as they had been in the previous movies as well. And it has been a blast to follow the characters and watch them in the quests and endeavors on the screen. And they had an abundance of really great actors and actresses to perform the various roles and bring their characters to life on the scree.For me this was a very full and wholeheartedly completion of the trilogy, one that had been so well lined up by Peter Jackson, and it delivered on all accounts.My rating for ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" is a solid eight out of ten stars.

"45"," An outstanding example of portrayal of a classic book
","d.tolfree","1 March 2004",NA,"
                Thousands of comments have been made on this outstanding production and there is little left to write that has not already been written or said. Again, not surprisingly at last night's 'Oscars', the third film in the trilogy took most of the awards. Like others I could give glowing comments about content, acting, production, direction, visual effects etc. but will instead, convey what I consider to be equally important;  that is the realistic and accurate portrayal of a classic masterpiece of literature from one of the world's most imaginative authors. I have tried and failed three times to completely read the book and I enjoy reading, but feel that I could now do so and have a better understanding of the story - only because I know that Peter Jackson set out to retain accuracy of the story. Sometimes our own imagination lacks the ability to see exactly what the author intended and if a film can help that, then it only adds to the experience. By timely coincidence as I write this my computer screen saver has put up a picture of a mountain valley in New Zealand - it must know what is in my mind. That beautiful country was perhaps the ideal setting for the film with its mystical landscape punctuated with mountain valleys, rivers, forests and open spaces. It cannot be far from what may have been in Tolkien's own  mind.I would perhaps add one comment about content. Although there was much reliance on computer visualisation it was well-balanced by emotional acting like the characters Gollum and Gandalf. Although Gollum was a villain, I actually was made to feel sorry for him at the end. Too many potentially good films are spoilt by substituting acting for over indulgence in special effects. This is an art that the producers and directors of this film had exactly right.I hope that the success of this trilogy will herald a new era in film-making of classical stories. Our literature has a wealth of candidates, and even ones that have been tried could be re-visited now that such experiences as Lord of the Rings have proved financially viable and immensely popular.

                I suppose that someone, sometime, may tell the story more accurately but I doubt very much that it will ever be told better. Nothing could ever replace the books for pure escapism but Peter Jackson has managed to evoke both the feel and texture of Tolkien's masterwork without pandering, too much, to clichéd Hollywood extravagance. The cast are superb (if Sir Ian Mckellen is remembered for nothing else other than Gandalf I feel sure he would not complain), the cinematography stunning and the pace, even over the 8/9 hours for the whole trilogy is matchless. For those who have read the books (as I have for many years) I would suggest watching once to get all of the niggling storyline changes/omissions out of your system then just watch as a pure, wonderous, unadulterated piece of epic, EPIC cinema. I'm sure I will love it forever.

                This was probably my favorite trilogy of all time, as throughout movie history there have not been all that many good fantasy movies that have been released so these films fill that void for me.  This last chapter wraps up the story nicely as Frodo and Sam are very close to where they need to be and the army of Sauron are trying to finish off man once and for all.  This movie is a bit different than the last one in the fact that the Hobbits Frodo and Sam and Gandolf the wizard are more of the focus of this one rather than Aragon, Gimli, and Legolos who were more the focus of the last one.  This one has epic battles and great visuals as well.  It is also very well acted.  Sean Astin does a particularly good job as Sam in this one as his character has a lot more impact in this one.  All in all a very good movie that wrapped up a very good trilogy that was one of the few that did not have a weak movie in the bunch.  I would write more, but I am sure there are plenty of reviews that do the movie more justice than I can.

                I can't talk about the film as much as I want, I'm afraid I wouldn't get the name rights, the locations or the characters who weren't there from the start, I'm even afraid some events or scenes escaped my attention, but I know I love poetry, and the last twenty minutes reminded of these words from Du Bellay.""Happy the man who, journeying far and wide As Jason or Ulysses did, can then Turn homeward, seasoned in the ways of men, And claim his own, and there in peace abide!""This is one of the most famous verses of French Renaissance and I can't think of a movie that captures the innermost joy and relief of homecoming as the third and final installment of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy did. Even the title carries this regal glory and satisfyingly conclusive nature. And through this ""Return of the King"", Aragorn, to name him, also ends the journey of Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas, Gollum and so many names that, two years earlier, could only -no pun intended- ring a bell among Tolkien's readers. I know they were many of them as we're talking of the most outstanding work of fiction from the second half the 20th century, but I suspect Peter Jackson multiplied the number of fans by a two-digit number, with a cinematic wizardry of Gandalfian proportions. Extending my statement about Jackson in the first film's review, there's indeed more than a hobbit within the New Zealand director.But for honesty's sake, and not to spoil my enthusiasm, I must confess I never read Tolkien's books, I've never been into medieval and Fantasy world anyway, although I know the story wasn't intended to venture in the realm of magic and fantasy alone. I enjoyed the first movie because it pushed me into a world daringly unique and imaginative, but so obsessed with its own reality that it almost confined to realism. More than the plot, I cared for the characters, because they seemed ""to have a story before the story"", they were not cardboard heroes or villains; they were archetypal but never at the expense of depth and obscurity. Despite these strengths, I welcomed the second film with perplexity because the surprise was gone and the entertaining value was inevitably hanging on the set-ups from the first film and the expectation of the third, situations that were no-more or that were yet-to-come. Unlike its two predecessors, the final film is great on its own. Everything has been said about the visual imagery and on that level, with the magnificent shots, battle sequences and that defining image of Gandalf the Grey arriving at Minas Tirith, Jackson really pushed the envelope and broke new grounds in the field of special effects, CGI wouldn't be a curse word anymore. But all the sets of skills in the world wouldn't amount to anything without a story.Indeed, I was surprised by how moving the final act was. The last thirty minutes of ""The Return of the King"" provided some of the most emotional moments of the last twenty years, something whose resonance transcends the limits of the Fantasy genre. And that's an even greater achievement than special effects, Jackson had created characters who had their own special effect, built over the course of two movies, that equals the lengths of three actually, allowed us to get emotionally involved with them. I compared Gandalf with Obi-Wan in the first opus' review but he doesn't deserve any comparison, he's in a class of his own. The bravery of Aragorn, the relationship between Gimli and Legolas, the torment of Gollum and of course, the friendship between Sam and Frodo could finally culminate.And in this glorious gallery, Sam is perhaps the unsung hero of the film because he suffered no fear or hesitation, he was Frodo's guardian angel with unshakable loyalty from beginning to end, and never let his ego trespass in his sense of duty. Of all the characters, this is the one I had a soft spot on, and from the ending, I have the feeling, this is what the long epilogue was trying to convey as without him, all the battles and desperate efforts would have lead to nowhere and forget about the ring, his smile and satisfaction in the end, is perhaps the true emotional reward. Indeed, the Ring was only a plot-driver, the film is about people, who overcome the adversity and come full circle with their own personalities, who seek for the peace of the world, for their own peace's sake. And what a price for peace! What a magnificent journey coming to an end, and what a satisfying ending! The first two films ended with interrogation marks, with an urge to see more, there was excitement, but an excitement pending over the reception of the next opus, undermined by the uncertainty. This film closes the chapter and leaves with overwhelming emotions and inner satisfaction; it is a ""The End"" in the tradition of Hollywood epics. And this glorious finale redeems all the flaws or the little imprecision from the first, all the removed chapters or cut sections. Speaking of Hollywood, the film is also known for being the third to get eleven Oscars (including Best Picture) with other classics like ""Ben Hur"" and ""Titanic"" I guess it is the reward of the whole trilogy, whose last opus was the apotheosis, something that proved that cinema had this unique capability to transport you into a world where imagination and reality made one. And Peter Jackson is one name to be chanted by the bards of the ""Lord of the Rings"" Pantheon, for he ensured the popularity of the saga, by translating it into a new language, a new medium. This was a Herculean task that the third hobbit, third wizard, third cinematic genius marvelously accomplished for one of the best cinematic thirds ever.

                After making two amazing epics, somehow Peter Jackson was able to save the best till last. Here we have the amazing conclusion to the War of the Ring, a brilliant adaption of a fantasy classic.Despite the victory at Helm's Deep and the defeat of Saruman (Christopher Lee) they is still a lot to do for the free people of Middle-Earth and the Fellowship of the Ring. After Pippen (Billy Boyd) seeing into the Palantír the Fellowship discover Sauron's plan of invading Gondor, and take their main city Minas Tirith. Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen) and Pippen go to Minas Tirith which is under the rule of Denethor (John Noble) who has fallen into madness. The kingdom of Rohan lead by King Theoden (Bernard Hill) attempts to muster enough of his own forces to fight, but lacks the numbers. This forces Aragon (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) to take a dangerous path to ensure victory is possible. And in the midst of the wide battles is Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) attempt to take the One Ring to Mount Doom, under the supposed help of Gollum (Andy Serkins). But Gollum too has his own plans to lead Frodo and Sam to their deaths and take the ring for himself. There are also sub-plots to the action, like Éowyn (Miranda Otto) and Merry's (Dominic Monaghan) desire to fight in the battle, Aragon's doubts to become King and Arwen's (Liv Tyler) fate being tired to the fate of the war and the ring.Peter Jackson directs and co-writes a faithfully adaption of final novel in the trilogy. This is a an action-packed film that had drama at his it heart. It is an adventure film where people do die and the consequences of failure are sky high. This is the least comedic out of all three films, but it's better because of it. Jackson still adds a sense of fun to a mostly serious film and the battle scenes are some of the best ever put to film. This is a more loyal adaption to the previous film which ruined the Faramir character. They are some things that were left out which would nice to see in the film, like characters like the Prince Imrahil, the only Gondor man capable of leadership because Denethor lost his mind and Faramir was injured. It would have been good to see Saruman taking over the Shire like at the end of the book, the only really major thing that was left out. But for the most part changes were made in the film were minor or necessary to trim down the film. This is the film with some of the best lines in the series, like Aragorn's speeches and Sam carrying Frodo (that bit was taken straight from the book).There is top quality acting. Andy Serkis should have had a Oscar nod for best supporting actor. Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin and Sir Ian McKellen are of particular note. It is also Elijah Wood's and Orlando Bloom's best performances.This film is a great example of excellent art direction, film music and costume design. Everyone who was involves deserves credit.The Extended Cut is the best way to watch this film. The scene with Bruce Spence as The Mouth of Sauron is worth it alone.A must see.

"52"," An outstanding example of portrayal of a classic book
","d.tolfree","1 March 2004",NA,"
                Thousands of comments have been made on this outstanding production and there is little left to write that has not already been written or said. Again, not surprisingly at last night's 'Oscars', the third film in the trilogy took most of the awards. Like others I could give glowing comments about content, acting, production, direction, visual effects etc. but will instead, convey what I consider to be equally important;  that is the realistic and accurate portrayal of a classic masterpiece of literature from one of the world's most imaginative authors. I have tried and failed three times to completely read the book and I enjoy reading, but feel that I could now do so and have a better understanding of the story - only because I know that Peter Jackson set out to retain accuracy of the story. Sometimes our own imagination lacks the ability to see exactly what the author intended and if a film can help that, then it only adds to the experience. By timely coincidence as I write this my computer screen saver has put up a picture of a mountain valley in New Zealand - it must know what is in my mind. That beautiful country was perhaps the ideal setting for the film with its mystical landscape punctuated with mountain valleys, rivers, forests and open spaces. It cannot be far from what may have been in Tolkien's own  mind.I would perhaps add one comment about content. Although there was much reliance on computer visualisation it was well-balanced by emotional acting like the characters Gollum and Gandalf. Although Gollum was a villain, I actually was made to feel sorry for him at the end. Too many potentially good films are spoilt by substituting acting for over indulgence in special effects. This is an art that the producers and directors of this film had exactly right.I hope that the success of this trilogy will herald a new era in film-making of classical stories. Our literature has a wealth of candidates, and even ones that have been tried could be re-visited now that such experiences as Lord of the Rings have proved financially viable and immensely popular.

                I suppose that someone, sometime, may tell the story more accurately but I doubt very much that it will ever be told better. Nothing could ever replace the books for pure escapism but Peter Jackson has managed to evoke both the feel and texture of Tolkien's masterwork without pandering, too much, to clichéd Hollywood extravagance. The cast are superb (if Sir Ian Mckellen is remembered for nothing else other than Gandalf I feel sure he would not complain), the cinematography stunning and the pace, even over the 8/9 hours for the whole trilogy is matchless. For those who have read the books (as I have for many years) I would suggest watching once to get all of the niggling storyline changes/omissions out of your system then just watch as a pure, wonderous, unadulterated piece of epic, EPIC cinema. I'm sure I will love it forever.

                This was probably my favorite trilogy of all time, as throughout movie history there have not been all that many good fantasy movies that have been released so these films fill that void for me.  This last chapter wraps up the story nicely as Frodo and Sam are very close to where they need to be and the army of Sauron are trying to finish off man once and for all.  This movie is a bit different than the last one in the fact that the Hobbits Frodo and Sam and Gandolf the wizard are more of the focus of this one rather than Aragon, Gimli, and Legolos who were more the focus of the last one.  This one has epic battles and great visuals as well.  It is also very well acted.  Sean Astin does a particularly good job as Sam in this one as his character has a lot more impact in this one.  All in all a very good movie that wrapped up a very good trilogy that was one of the few that did not have a weak movie in the bunch.  I would write more, but I am sure there are plenty of reviews that do the movie more justice than I can.

                I can't talk about the film as much as I want, I'm afraid I wouldn't get the name rights, the locations or the characters who weren't there from the start, I'm even afraid some events or scenes escaped my attention, but I know I love poetry, and the last twenty minutes reminded of these words from Du Bellay.""Happy the man who, journeying far and wide As Jason or Ulysses did, can then Turn homeward, seasoned in the ways of men, And claim his own, and there in peace abide!""This is one of the most famous verses of French Renaissance and I can't think of a movie that captures the innermost joy and relief of homecoming as the third and final installment of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy did. Even the title carries this regal glory and satisfyingly conclusive nature. And through this ""Return of the King"", Aragorn, to name him, also ends the journey of Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Gimli, Legolas, Gollum and so many names that, two years earlier, could only -no pun intended- ring a bell among Tolkien's readers. I know they were many of them as we're talking of the most outstanding work of fiction from the second half the 20th century, but I suspect Peter Jackson multiplied the number of fans by a two-digit number, with a cinematic wizardry of Gandalfian proportions. Extending my statement about Jackson in the first film's review, there's indeed more than a hobbit within the New Zealand director.But for honesty's sake, and not to spoil my enthusiasm, I must confess I never read Tolkien's books, I've never been into medieval and Fantasy world anyway, although I know the story wasn't intended to venture in the realm of magic and fantasy alone. I enjoyed the first movie because it pushed me into a world daringly unique and imaginative, but so obsessed with its own reality that it almost confined to realism. More than the plot, I cared for the characters, because they seemed ""to have a story before the story"", they were not cardboard heroes or villains; they were archetypal but never at the expense of depth and obscurity. Despite these strengths, I welcomed the second film with perplexity because the surprise was gone and the entertaining value was inevitably hanging on the set-ups from the first film and the expectation of the third, situations that were no-more or that were yet-to-come. Unlike its two predecessors, the final film is great on its own. Everything has been said about the visual imagery and on that level, with the magnificent shots, battle sequences and that defining image of Gandalf the Grey arriving at Minas Tirith, Jackson really pushed the envelope and broke new grounds in the field of special effects, CGI wouldn't be a curse word anymore. But all the sets of skills in the world wouldn't amount to anything without a story.Indeed, I was surprised by how moving the final act was. The last thirty minutes of ""The Return of the King"" provided some of the most emotional moments of the last twenty years, something whose resonance transcends the limits of the Fantasy genre. And that's an even greater achievement than special effects, Jackson had created characters who had their own special effect, built over the course of two movies, that equals the lengths of three actually, allowed us to get emotionally involved with them. I compared Gandalf with Obi-Wan in the first opus' review but he doesn't deserve any comparison, he's in a class of his own. The bravery of Aragorn, the relationship between Gimli and Legolas, the torment of Gollum and of course, the friendship between Sam and Frodo could finally culminate.And in this glorious gallery, Sam is perhaps the unsung hero of the film because he suffered no fear or hesitation, he was Frodo's guardian angel with unshakable loyalty from beginning to end, and never let his ego trespass in his sense of duty. Of all the characters, this is the one I had a soft spot on, and from the ending, I have the feeling, this is what the long epilogue was trying to convey as without him, all the battles and desperate efforts would have lead to nowhere and forget about the ring, his smile and satisfaction in the end, is perhaps the true emotional reward. Indeed, the Ring was only a plot-driver, the film is about people, who overcome the adversity and come full circle with their own personalities, who seek for the peace of the world, for their own peace's sake. And what a price for peace! What a magnificent journey coming to an end, and what a satisfying ending! The first two films ended with interrogation marks, with an urge to see more, there was excitement, but an excitement pending over the reception of the next opus, undermined by the uncertainty. This film closes the chapter and leaves with overwhelming emotions and inner satisfaction; it is a ""The End"" in the tradition of Hollywood epics. And this glorious finale redeems all the flaws or the little imprecision from the first, all the removed chapters or cut sections. Speaking of Hollywood, the film is also known for being the third to get eleven Oscars (including Best Picture) with other classics like ""Ben Hur"" and ""Titanic"" I guess it is the reward of the whole trilogy, whose last opus was the apotheosis, something that proved that cinema had this unique capability to transport you into a world where imagination and reality made one. And Peter Jackson is one name to be chanted by the bards of the ""Lord of the Rings"" Pantheon, for he ensured the popularity of the saga, by translating it into a new language, a new medium. This was a Herculean task that the third hobbit, third wizard, third cinematic genius marvelously accomplished for one of the best cinematic thirds ever.

                The end of Middle-Earth draws near as the armies of orcs march against Minas Tirith, the great city of Gondor and the last bastion of Men, while at the same time Frodo and Sam have reached the borders of Mordor with their guide Gollum. Darkness spreads and all hope seems to wane, for even if the diminishing strength of Men were to prevail against crushing odds, their fate rests on the shoulders of a hobbit, the smallest of beings.The Return of the King is an epic conclusion to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. All the individual plot lines come crashing together as we witness the last great battle between the forces of good and evil. This is grand fantasy at its finest. Every time you're allowed to draw breath and every time you hold your breath in fear and terror, there's something new and even more majestic waiting to reveal itself. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields in front of Minas Tirith is probably the finest individual battle scene I've ever seen put on film. An opinion shared by many. And the thing is, it has aged remarkably well. Here and there you can spot the use of CGI, but not often. I've seen big budget movies this year, full twelve years later, which look noticeably worse than this film in that regard.I also really like how the scale shows not just in battle scenes but in every other aspect as well. The dialogues are full of emotions, great speeches, deep feelings, talks about fate, the elusiveness of hope, the strength of belief. Sure, it's escapism, but at its finest. This movie is the prime example of why we still tell stories to ourselves.And yeah, I'm the first to admit that this is the most flawed film in the trilogy. They have turned Gimli into a complete joke character at this point. There are perhaps one or two endings too many. The ghost army subplot comes a bit out of nowhere. The emotions do boil over a touch too much. But in the end, I still love this film and this world. It is an archetype, an ideal against which all alike stories are measured.The Return of the King is my least favourite film in The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It's still easily one of my favourite movies, one of the finest epic movies ever made and more than worthy of all its praise.

                This movie brought together everything the first two laid out, tied them into nice, neat little bundles, and concluded the whole trilogy just as it should. It does not conclude as you wish it to, but rather as Tolkien intended.The battle scenes were simply awesome this time around. With Helm's Deep, we were amazed, but Pelennor fields and Minas Tirith will leave you absolutely stunned; truly in awe of the mastery involved.""Mastery."" That is a good word, and very aptly describes this production; Masterful. The sets and props were again pure perfection.The performances were of the very best, most deliberate and heart-wrenching, uplifting realistic performances on film to date. The changes made in the story were small changes and not even note-worthy; the direction staff did a marvelous job rewriting this beloved classic with all the creativity, care and love they had to offer. LotR is now my favorite movie series to date. Star Wars held that position in my heart since its release, followed by the subsequent two installments, but this, the ""Return of the King,"" is the most imaginatively creative work I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing.I simply cannot wait to own the third Extended Edition Gift Set featuring this masterpiece.I will not give away the details, as many here have (and without SPOILER warnings, I might add). I will leave that for someone else.EDIT: This was literally the very best movie I've ever seen! I cannot recommend the 4-disk Extended Collector's Edition Gift Set ENOUGH! Wow! There is SO much more movie here than there was in the theatrical version!As did the first two installments, this movie rates a full 10/10 from the Fiend. Would that I could, it would receive 5 extra bonus points for pure creativity.the Fiend :.

                Even the most incredible stories ever told must come to an end, and the final entry of the Lord of the Rings doesn't disappoint in any way, shape or form as it accomplishes something few other trilogies have: every single installment is 10 out of 10. Like its predecessor, the storyline is extremely long and complex, but due to the wondrous music, acting, dialogue, special effects and everything else, you'd be insane not to find it riveting. The plot starts where The Two Towers left off. Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin respectively) are trying to make their way to Mount Doom located in the realm of Mordor alongside the malformed creature Smeagol in order to destroy the One Ring. Meanwhile, the wizard Gandalf (Ian IcKellen) along with the warriors Gimli, Aragorn, Legolas, and the Rohan King Theoden (John Rhys-Davies, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom and Bernard Hill respectively) advance to Isengard, which has been subdued by a race of sentient trees in the last film. The evil wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee) appears and is stabbed by his fellow wizard Gríma after Legolas accidentally hits him with one of his arrows. After Saruman is killed, Gandalf now possesses his palantír, an object that looks like a crystal ball with a whole other world inside of it. Merry and Pippin, the two hobbits from the last movie, try to look at the palantír once Gandalf falls asleep and find the menacing Eye of Sauron staring back. Also seen is a burning tree, indicative of the Kingdom of Gondor. Gandalf realizes this probably means the Orc armies of Mordor plan to assault Minas Tirith, Gondor's capital. Gandalf and the others go to this place to meet with Denethor, the leader of Gondor and father of Boromir (Sean Bean) from the first film. Pippin is instructed by Gandalf to light beacons so Rohan knows Minas needs assistance. Concurrently, Frodo, Sam and Smeagol continue to push towards the dark realm, the first two not realizing Smeagol plans to seize the Ring for himself. After seeing the Witch-king (leader of the ringwraiths) fly off on a dragon-like creature, a huge army of orc soldiers comes flooding across a bridge. Frodo and his companions climb their way to safety and out of sight. Smeagol later accuses Sam of eating the last of Frodo's food, and Frodo, seemingly being controlled by the Ring's malevolent influence, coldly tells him to go home. Frodo is then traveling through a spiderweb ridden cavern completely alone and later attacked by a spider named Shelob many times his size. Smeagol is pushed into a chasm by Frodo and supposedly killed, but Frodo is again ambushed by the spider, which proceeds to sting him into a coma. It looks like this is the end for him, but Sam decided to return and fights Shelob with a sword. The spider is driven away, but Sam has to stay in the shadows when a group of orcs approach and see the hapless Frodo lying motionless. They pick him up and take him to Mordor. Back at Gondor, Theoden assembles his forces and Aragorn is given Andúril by the half elf Elrond; a sword with unmatched magical power. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas traverse a dark and vast cave area containing thousands of human remains and restless ghosts, unable to find peace in the afterlife. Aragorn uses the power of his sword to convince the ghosts he will undo their curse if they agree to help in the defense of Minas Tirith. The orcs attack the city in huge numbers, break down the heavily fortified door with a huge battering ram called the Wolf's Head, and breach the defenses. Denethor tries to immolate himself as he believes all is lost, and jumps to his death after being set on fire. Theoden leads his forces against the orcs and does well, but is later routed by ringwraiths and pirates from Harad who ride enormous war elephants dozens of feet tall. The leader of the ringwraiths attacks Theoden and nearly kills him, until his niece Éowyn decapitates its dragon and fatally stabs its master. Theoden dies, but Aragorn, now backed by the innumerable ghosts from earlier, tear into Sauron's fighters. After the battle, Aragorn keeps his word and the ghosts are finally at rest. Aragorn and the others sense that Frodo is close to his objective now, so in order to take pressure off him, Gondor's forces fight Sauron's at the Black Gate which leads into Mordor. After the Eye of Sauron sets its gaze on Frodo, he collapses and Sam has to carry him. Smeagol suddenly appears and tackles Sam and tries to strangle Frodo, but is knocked out by Sam. He and Frodo at long last enter Mount Doom, where Frodo needs to drop the Ring into the lava below to destroy it once and for all. He steps as far as the precarious walkway will take him, but hesitates to drop it in. Frodo gives in to the Ring's evil power and puts it on, becoming invisible. Smeagol jumps on Frodo and savagely bites off one of his fingers, freeing the Ring. As Frodo fights Smeagol above a pit of unending lava, the latter is pushed in and dies. The Ring is melted down, and Sauron's Tower crumbles and explodes, killing the rest of his forces fighting Gandalf and the others. The volcano Frodo is in erupts, and he and Sam barely get out before being swallowed by lava. Gandalf later rescues Sam and Frodo with giant eagles as they lay on a molten rock, and they attend a ceremony where Aragorn is crowned the new King of Gondor. Returning to the Shire, Sam gets married, and Frodo decides to leave Middle-Earth with his uncle Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf. When Bilbo asks what happened to the Ring he gave his nephew years ago, Frodo tells him he must have lost it. This entire movie is just so well put together it's almost mythical. It does not feel like I just sat through 4 and a half hours at all, and just like the previous 2, I'm very confident when I say you can pause this film at any time and it will resemble a Renaissance painting. The landscapes, battles, and sheer size of what's being shown really do Tolkien proud. The music is phenomenal, and really raises the bar for what fantasy movie soundtracks ought to sound like. Howard Shore's compositions are what other soundtracks should aspire to be. The special effects still look awe-inspiring and this film looks like it was just released last week. It even has comic relief (mostly in the form of Gimli) since those involved clearly understand the importance of humor in an otherwise serious film. Overall, due to its masterful direction and everything else I made note of (and the things I didn't), I'm inclined to say Return of the King is one of those movies that will make most other films you watch look mediocre, but it is so very worth it. This trilogy concluded in the best possible manner and I don't think it could have gone any better.

                I think that almost everything that can be said about this trilogy has been said already, but still I will try. There are so many films that destroyed the beauty and perfection of the novels they have been built upon, not this one. In front of an amazingly beautiful scenery, Peter Jackson was able to create a fantasy-movie, which unlike so many others before did not deal with old clichés and thus is far away from any trash-movie a lot of people had expected it to be beforehand.Although I am sure that the cast of this film will soon be forgotten, The ""The Lord of the Rings""-trilogy will stand the times and be one of the most renowned pictures of the las decade.

                Tolkien's works were adapted for TV with animation by Rankin/Bass (1977 and 1979). In 1978, Ralph Bakshi brought the first two books of the famous trilogy to the silver screen. And now, with today's technology, an all-star cast, and a fabulous music score, New Line Cinema has brought the trilogy to a new level as a live-action spectacle and one of the best film series of the 21st century. Each scene has heart, a bit of humour, heart-thumping action, and excellent effects. And I should like to tell you that Rings is what got me to love four of the film's stars: Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen, and Liv Tyler.In this adrenaline-rushing conclusion of our adventure, the War of the Ring has begun, and Frodo and Sam (who are led by Gollum) continue their dangerous quest to destroy the One Ring. But they are unaware of the trap that was set for them by Gollum. Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, and Gandalf united with Merry and Pippin at the now-destroyed Isengard, thanks to Treebeard and the other Ents. Now the friends celebrated their victory, but Aragorn was worried about Frodo. And in the dead of the night, Pippin snuck out of bed to take a peek at Saruman's palantir, which had been found and confiscated. But then something happened: the palantir revealed The Eye of Sauron and his plans to attack Minas Tirith, so Gandalf took Pippin and rode to Minas Tirith. Meanwhile, on the road to the ships that will take elves away from Middle Earth, Arwen was thinking over her choice of path. Until a vision of her son convinces her to return home. So she rode home and begged her father to resurrect Narsil's ancient blade and give it to her beloved Aragorn, so he could become the king he was born to be.So overall, all three films are excellent. And you know, I do feel sorry for Faramir for being the unappreciated son; I mean, it was his big brother Boromir who was their dad's favorite. I love the friendship that is developing between Merry and Eowyn. And I love the end-title song performed by Annie Lennox.

                To justify the title, I can count many merits of the movie. The background score is grand and powerful, the story is handled very well, and the CGI is balanced and beautiful. But, in the third act of the movie, there are 3 major scenes, each of which brought me to complete tears. One of them is the greatest single moment I've ever seen in movies, period. Throughout the movie, it's very evident that it was made by people who clearly adored the source and a great attention to detail can be found throughout.I've seen complaints that at some points the movie diverges from the source material too much or that it's longer and doesn't pack as much substance. I feel the first point can be validated by artistic liberties, while the second ultimately boils down to personal preferences. Speaking personally, the movie did not feel long. The screenplay justifies the runtime, and makes the movie cohesive. It's the grand finale to the greatest trilogy of all time, and completely cements its legacy for years to come.NOTE: This review is based off of the special extended editions, and not the theatrical cut.

                The third and final installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy comes to life bigger, and bolder than the first two. Director Peter Jackson and company held nothing back when it came to CGI, special effects, gorgeous landscapes, and breathtaking cinematography.Fans most familiar with Tolkien's famed novels would take note of changes made in the interest of keeping the film short (as with it's two prior films), but he stuck close enough the main story and brought it to its destined conclusion. He didn't water down the scene where Frodo finally gets to Mt. Doom in order to get rid of The One Ring once and for allin fact it packs quite the punch. The way that scene was intermingled with the battle footage heightened the emotional level of the scene as well as the excitement.The actors deserve praise as well. Viggo Mortensen reminds us of what a hero truly is, with his performance as Aragorn, the man who would become King of Gondor. Sir Ian McKellen reprises his role as Gandalf the White, bringing the Wizard to life as if he popped right out of the pages of Tolkien's novels. Elijah Wood draws us in with his portrayal as FrodoSorrowful, and weary of his travels and all of the trials he'd gone through along the way. Other noteworthy performances include those of Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchet, Miranda Otto, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, Hugo Weaving, etc.I highly recommend this film (as well as it's predecessors) to anybody, regardless of whether or not you've read the novels. Of course the books are betterthey always arebut the movies are an excellent adaptation of Tolkien's wonderful tale.This film is clearly worthy of the many Oscars it has won.I easily give it a 10/10.

                These films are glorious and they finished off this marvellous trilogy with a bang. Unlimited action and emotional plot twist and character arcs. Cinematography is just unparalleled to other trilogies.I have to say the more I watch this trilogy the more I put it up there with the Star Wars Classics.Timeless.

                So I have now made my way through The Lord Of The Rings trilogy and that culminates with The Return Of The King, one of the biggest films ever made and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees the forces of Gondor & Rohan fight to protect Middle Earth from the forces of Mordor while Frodo, Sam & Gollum get closer to Mount Doom and their endgame.Main Character
Elijah Wood is back as Frodo and I think he does a great job in selling just how tough the journey has been on Frodo compared to the other characters. The ring is just weighing him down and this film in particular he is really struggling with it and finding his mind on the brink. I mean Frodo isn't the most likeable character for parts of this film but I thought Wood did a great job in portraying the anxiety and torment that Frodo has gone through in this trilogy. Viggo Mortenson plays Aragorn and talking about his character is pretty funny, I mean the title of the film spoils his whole character arc but he is still great here and does well in his role and just does a great job as a protagonist.Supporting Characters
Sean Astin does a really good job in the first two films but this is the film where he really stands out and for me gives the best performance in the film. There is a line in The Two Towers where Frodo says he wouldn't get far without Sam and you really see it in this film, as Frodo struggles Sam gets stronger and Astin does a fantastic job in this film as the moral centre. Sir Ian McKellen is given more to do here as Gandalf The White and he is great, he gets to see more of the action and nails every moment he is on screen and just adds so much to the film. Andy Serkis is also back as Gollum and the effects are even better here, Gollum looks fantastic and the character is fleshed out here and it even better, Serkis truly deserves credit for his role here and Gollum is also a real highlight of the film. The rest of the cast also do great jobs, Miranda Otto as Eowyn gets more to do here, Bernard Hill as Theoden gets more to do, Merry and Pippin have more to do and they are all fantastic and have really good character arcs, the whole cast really do a great job in the film.Story
The story is epic on all levels, more of the characters have interesting character arcs and more time to shine. The story is in three plots really, Frodo, Sam & Gollum, Gandalf & Pippin and the rest of the characters at Rohan, and all of it is really interesting. The film uses its extra runtime to flesh out more characters and makes the story be more epic and have more depth to it then the previous films. It ends the trilogy pretty much perfectly and does it really well with these characters that you will have grown to love over the 9 hours that you have watched.Script
The script is great, the dialogue and ways the characters are written takes these larger then life personalities and makes you care about them which is no mean feat. This film knows when to focus on the drama and it knows when to have a laugh, it balances the plot arcs very well and makes the film interesting from start to end.Style
This film is epic on scale, I mean it could be argued that in terms of scale this is the largest film ever, the battle scenes are huge in scale and raises the scale which was necessary for a final instalment of this epic franchise. The film has over 3 hours to tell its story and I think it does a good job of it and keeps the pacing high for pretty much the entire film which is a difficult thing to do.Overall
Overall, I mean this is The Return Of The King so of course it is amazing, this whole trilogy is one of the greatest of all time and if people haven't watched it then they just need to get on it, especially while we are in lockdown.Rating - 10/10.

                WHAT A MOVIE!!! THE SETS!!! THE MUSIC!!! THE VISUALS!!! THE ACTION!!!An amazing achievement in every sense of the word. The lack of action and slow pace of the The Two Towers is made up for here. The fight with Shelob, the rescue from Cirith Ungol, the Siege of Minas Tirith, the crossing of the plains of Mordor, and the destruction of the RING. ALL HERE!!! All amazing!There can be said nothing negative of this film. I was absolutely blown away in the theater. The Siege was done so well and is one of the best action scenes ever. Also, the end was amazing. The book dragged on a bit with the Shire and Saruman, but none of that is here. The destruction of the Ring destroys all evil, like it should! And the sequence when the Army of Gondor is at the Black Gate and Frodo, with Sam and Smeagol, are in Mount Doom is absolutely jaw dropping. The music, Aragorn's speech (almost like Henry V), and the action are a terrific culmination and serve as a truly breath-taking climax.However the film amazingly well done overall and easily the best out of the trilogy. The crew behind this film worked their butts of as there is no sign of sloppiness. It is all very well done, from beginning to end and it provides an awesome end to a great trilogy. 10/10

                and this is it. I was outrageously fortunate to attend last night's London premiere of King and, though I don't say such things lightly, this goes straight into the list of candidates for best film ever made. Rest assured, fans, less liberties are taken with the source material than was the case with Towers. But never mind the literary roots - this is CINEMA at its best. Spectacle to put Ben Hur or the Star Wars films to shame; emotion and the human dimension to rival American Beauty or even Casablanca; settings and cinematography that make you want to sell your flat tomorrow to get New Zealand air tickets; and, of course, astonishing performances. So, who to give the Oscars to? Besides Best Picture, Best Director for Peter Jackson and Best Score for Howard Shore - those I take as given. Surely Sean Astin for Samwise - and make that Best Actor in a Starring Role. It's a large main-character cast, so how do you define the star? Put simply, he provides the emotional core, the heart of the story and the summation of its message about fighting for what you believe in, about courage, friendship and love - and he does it SO well. Besides, the Supporting Oscar belongs to Andy Serkis for Smeagol / Gollum. OK, I'm finished, now. I'll leave writing a proper review to others this time; my gush will have to do, as I don't want to include any spoilers and I haven't time to do this sublime film justice. I'll just say: Go and see it. Repeatedly. And buy the DVD - extended again, please! (Though what else needs including besides Christopher Lee's seven minutes, I'm not sure.) Enjoy!

                It's very rare for the third film in a series to be good but The Return of the King has surpassed that and managed to become the best film in the LOTR trilogy.The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King shows Aragorn, Gandalf and the rest of the Fellowship getting ready to fight Sauron's army whilst Frodo and Sam approach Mount Doom in order to destroy the One Ring once and for all.It has all led to this. A 3 hour and 20 minute finale to end the Lord of the Rings story and it couldn't be better. This is my favourite out of all three films as I believe Peter Jackson has crafted one of the best finales to a film ever. It's amazing how much effort and work has gone into this trilogy as this film wouldn't have the same impact if the previous two weren't planned so well. All three films have such a fantastic connection with one another. A huge amount of credit goes to the entire team working on all three films.The Return of the King is the best one as this one ups the ante. If you thought the battle at the end of The Two Towers was impressive, the battle in this film is breathtaking. The fabulous camerawork, special effects and magnitude of the fight makes this a cinematic achievement. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and Howard Shore's epic score increases the intensity of the fight. I was in complete awe as nothing of this scale has been done before. I'm so happy the Academy recognised the work put into it.It's not just the fights that make this film perfect but the characters are fully developed here and given great closure. This film brings the most development to the Hobbits especially Pippin, Frodo and Sam. Pippin really grows in this film after realising what's going on and Billy Boyd did an excellent job. The friendship between Frodo and Sam developed so much here. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin were so good. Once again each actor shines and give outstanding performances.With The Return of the King, Peter Jackson has successfully created a perfect and memorable trilogy that set a new standard for filmmaking. Each scene builds up to an epic finale and ending that may make you cry. J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud!

                The Return of The king begins with a flashback of Gollum, when he recalls how he got the ring and how it turned him into what he is now. I really didn't expect a beginning like that. After that the movie continues from where we were left in The Two Towers.There is, in my opinion, no need to mention any other, as I have praised their work in my comments of previous movies, actors besides John Noble, who does without any doubt excellent job as Denethor, mad steward of Gondor, who in his grief for his oldest son Boromir (Sean Bean) cannot see the love of his youngest son Faramir (David Fenham).Isengard has fallen, but the dark lord Sauron still remains in his strong hold, behind the walls of Mordor. He is soon launching a full-scale attack towards Gondor. And if he were to win, that would mean fall of the human race.I was very exited to see TROTK and I was, I admit it, little bit scared, as the book is a massive story, with multiple story lines. Could Jackson tie them all together again? Over three hours later I was convinced: he could. But I still was little disappointed: there were scenes missing, like what happened to Saruman (Christopher Lee)? Where was his final confrontation whit Gandalf (Ian McKellen)? But I knew the EE was coming and I was confident, that everything would be in there. But still I was certain of one thing: I had seen one of the most stunning cinematic displays of my life.And my confidence was rewarded: more about pathway of the dead, Sarumans last stand in Isengard, meeting with Mouth of Sauron. It all was in there. Some scenes were just to add some lighthearted fun in the story some were more serious. Some, I admit, I could have lived without, but then again they did made me laugh out loud.After I had all the EE versions of the films, me and my friend spent a day watching those all films in a row. The trilogy was complete, all my fears were gone and last thing for me to do is lay back and enjoy.

                Every time I read that a series or movie cannot fully or somewhat faithfully translate a book, I am reminded of the LOFTR movies a great adaptation of a great literary classic, the atmosphere and the plot are well outlined and well adapted for the film, great performances, beautiful cinematography, beautiful scenery, beautiful music for me the LOFRT trilogy is ALMOST PERFECT.

"77"," Why did THIS one win the Oscar?
","Danimal-7","8 April 2004",NA,"
                Fellowship of the Ring was far and away the best of the three Lord of the Rings movies, and the Academy snubbed it.  The Two Towers was far less impressive, but that was understandable since the book of the Two Towers is the weakest of the original trilogy, and Jackson saved one of its best episodes, the confrontation between the hobbits and Shelob, for the third film.  The third film rebounds, as it ought to have given that the third book is the best, but it does not reach the level reached by the first movie, much less by the book.  Overall, Jackson did a good job, none of the movies is bad, and he deserves recognition for his work and the risks he took.  It's just hard not to feel disappointed, given the huge promise of the first movie, to find that the trilogy as a whole is quite good but nowhere near great.Certainly Jackson achieved a very impressive feat in constructing battle scenes that are even more exciting and terrifying than the excellent ones in the previous two movies.  The assault of Grond on the gate of Minas Tirith, the wild charge of the Rohirrim, the confrontation between Eowyn and the Lord of the Nazgul, and the desperate clash with the Oliphaunts are probably the finest fantasy warfare sequences ever filmed, managing to be intimate and detailed while also giving a sense of the overall strategic picture of the battle.  Kurosawa would have been hard put to do better.Too, Jackson pulled a major coup by constructing a version of the climactic scene at Mount Doom that will surprise the readers of the original book without disappointing them  and it would have been very easy to go wrong at this point.  And, Jackson manages a few times to do what he did with astonishing regularity in The Fellowship of the Ring: spot the dramatic moments and give them even more impact on film than they have on the printed page.  His version of the scenes in the Paths of the Dead and the lighting of the beacons of Gondor are masterful.But, Jackson has lost his eye for character; indeed, he has lost it so disastrously that I have to wonder whether his master portraits of Boromir and Gandalf in the first film were anything more than luck.  This is clearest in his revolting representation of Denethor.  Jackson's Denethor is a cretin: weak, craven, stupid, self-pitying, insensitive, spiteful, utterly devoid of redeeming features.  No man cut from this cloth could have lasted a month as Steward of Gondor, much less raised two of the boldest warriors of Minas Tirith or pitted his will against the Dark Lord Sauron for control of a Palantir.  The true story of Denethor, which Jackson misunderstood completely, is not of the crumbling of a coward, but what is infinitely more tragic, the crumbling of a brave man.Meanwhile, Gandalf has receded into Old Testament prophet mode, and seems to have no emotions of his own whatsoever.  Granted, even in the books Gandalf seems more distant and unapproachable after his reappearance, but he still had the old irritability and humor underneath.  Arwen, after being used so well in the first movie, again becomes an annoying hindrance to the plot. Gimli, at least, has improved somewhat since The Two Towers; he is still being used as comic relief, but the humor is now more of a deliberately self-deprecating kind than the humiliating pratfall jokes he had to suffer through last time.Also, I have to complain about some of the things that Jackson left out.  I will concede that he was right to omit two of my favorite parts: the meeting with Ghan-buri-Ghan and the Scouring of the Shire; time was limited, and something had to be cut.  (he could have omitted the Paths of the Dead too, if he'd had to, although that would have been a shame considering how well he did that sequence).  But the confrontation between Gandalf and the Witch-King of Angmar at the ruins of the Gate could have been done in thirty seconds, and the parley with the Mouth of Sauron would have required less than one minute to deliver one of the dramatic high points of the whole book.That Minas Tirith, Mount Doom, and the Grey Havens are magnificently done almost goes without saying.  Art direction has been the one consistent strong point throughout this whole trilogy.In all, The Return of the King is a good movie.  Certainly far worse ones have won Oscars.  I just hope that the award doesn't lead to people imagining that this is the best movie of the trilogy.Rating: *** out of ****.Recommendation:  Go see it on a big screen.  But watch The Fellowship of the Ring first.

                The Return of the King is a spectacle of sight and sound, valiance and camaraderie, with grander scale battle, though darker and less joyous.A mammoth tale, starting with Gollum before he was. A hobbit himself, who despite leading Frodo into a trap, saves the day by attacking him and falling to his demise with the ring. A great film, not without its flaws though. Eowyn killing the Witch-king of Angmar's silly and even Sam killing the giant spider and orcs as well, though the spider segment's awesome. More so though, the ghost army of the dead, some invincible force that just sweeps through everything. The film's more than the sum of its parts though, holding weight of the entire journey and endeavour and well worth the massive commitment of time to do so.

                Let me explain the action sequences in the first two Lord of the Rings movies. In The Fellowship of the Ring, there wasn't much action, just mostly running. In The Two Towers, it was fighting without much gore included. The third was simply mind-blowing with amazing fight scenes, and pretty much all the violence you could imagine. Don't get me wrong, violence truly isn't everything in a movie. But this had excellent special effects and fight scenes. This is a movie that will thoroughly spend 200 minutes of your time, and it's usually hard to find a movie like that. This movie is rare, adventurous, and enjoyable. Not a kid's movie.

                As I said in the reviews for the previous two chapters, I was curious for years about the LOTR trilogy because of ther reputation and many reviews. The first was great and a nice introduction, the second, while not outstanding, still good in some ways and the third... too great that it's a shame that you can't rate a movie with a score higher than 10, it's too damn perfect!After a prologue that shows us the origins of Gollum we join Gandalf, Eomer, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas (Ian McKellen, Karl Urban, Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies and Orlando Bloom) that on the way to Isengard meet Merry and Tuc (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) that tell them about Treebeard that won against Saruman who is now imprisoned in the tower of Orthanc. Gandalf then goes to Denethor for preparing him for Sauron's attack but Denethor is insane because his son Boromir (Sean Bean) died: in the meanwhile Frodo, Samwise (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) and Gollum arrive to Minas Morgul where Gollum makes Frodo believe that Sam wants the precious ring, but Sam will save Frodo from a giant spider. After a long battle Aragorn, Gimli, Legolas and the army of the dead ogres arrive to Gondor, and now they don't have any other choice than go to Mordor, so that Frodo can go to Mount Doom for destroying the ring. Frodo is attacked by the ogres only to be saved by Sam, and can finally throw the ring in the lava despite a fight with Gollum. After the ring melts, the army or Mordor goes away and Sauron's spirit is defeated forever. Frodo and Sam are saved by the eagles and are taken to Gondor, and the day after in Minas Tirith there is the crowning of Aragorn as the new king and the celebration of his wedding with Arwen (Liv Tyler). In the end we see Bilbo finishing his book and Frodo decides to travel with the last elves left to Valinor.The sets are huge and spectacular at the same time, and the money was spent well for the scope. The performances by all (Mortensen, Bloom, Astin, Cate Blanchett, Wood, McKellen, Tyler and Rhys Davies) were all the great, and the soundtrack was on par with all the other settings. I especially loved the song OVER THE HORIZON by Annie Lennox towards the end credits, it was that great. The battle scenes and special effects were marvellous considering it was made in 2003.Overall, a must for fans of the trilogy and besides that, a masterpiece that has to be seen at least once for its greatness, it's that powerful!

                As an avid Star Wars fan since the age of ten, I never thought anything could supplant the classic trilogy...but I was wrong. The Lord of the Rings with Return of the King as the grand finale, is truly the greatest film of all time. Watching this beloved classic has become a heartwarming and thrilling classic that never gets old, viewed year after year. I am emotionally and spiritually drained and uplifted every time. JRR Tolkien and Peter Jackson have brought to life the most inspiring and enjoyable tale of all time. I have never before or since enjoyed a set of films as I have these. Beautiful and breath-taking beyond words, Lord of the Rings is the Masterpiece for the ages!

                As the saying goes, ""All good things must come to an end"", but seldom does one wish to refute such a statement as strongly as in the case of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Tolkien had become a holiday tradition, leaving the prospect of a December without Middle Earth an almost overwhelmingly bleak future. After struggling through over six hours of emotional investment, viewer expectations were at a critical peak: how could such a painstakingly, lovingly constructed journey possibly be brought to a satisfying conclusion? Suffice to say, the film does not disappoint, its ensuing 11 Academy Awards still seeming to fall short of properly appreciating the triumphant masterpiece of a conclusion. The title proves prophetic, as the film marked the true ascent of Jackson's films into the realm of abiding classics.Debate over which film can be regarded as the strongest of the three continues eternal and remains largely a matter of individual taste, but a strong case can be made for Return of the King being at least the most rounded of the trilogy. With epic, rousing battle scenes to match any set pieces of The Two Towers and heartfelt emotional moments to rival any in Fellowship of the Ring, Return of the King exemplifies the trilogy's strengths while providing the necessary catharsis for the entire painstaking journey. And an emotional climax it is, as Jackson delves into the darkest and most tumultuous expedition into Middle- Earth. From the first notes of Howard Shore's flat out stunning musical score, the viewer is ensnared, as Jackson generates gruellingly heartfelt emotional resonance with awe-inspiring ease. Only in the hands of such a confident filmmaker could such unbridled sentiment steer clear of the embarrassingly melodramatic, but in such an engrossingly crafted world, even the most stilted lines ring as rousing, genuine and emotionally resonant - it would be a feat indeed for any viewer, no matter how jaded, to hold back tears at the film's wrenching finale. Despite the occasional trimmed scene (fans of the novel may lament Saruman's death scene, seen on the DVD extended edition), Jackson as always remains obsessively faithful to Tolkien's vision, and while the enormous running time and conclusion after conclusion may prove trying to those unfamiliar with Tolkien's works, it is impossible to imagine a more satisfying adaptation of the timeless novel.But even viewers spoiled on Jackson's first two takes on Tolkien's fantasy world will find themselves spellbound by the visual mastery on display. Easily a pinnacle of cinematic aesthetics, Jackson's Middle-Earth remains an indescribably lush, expansive tapestry of imaginative beauty. Seldom has a world been so credibly and completely generated, with staggering attention to detail ranging from the vast action set pieces (Jackson gleefully indulges his schlocky horror roots with Frodo and Sam's eerie, unbearably tense battle with monstrous spider Shelob, and lets rip with the enthralling siege of Gondor. And if his cross- cutting between Gondor's face-off with the combined armies of Mordor and the overwhelmingly heightened volcanic climax at Mount Doom can become infuriating - I'm prone to yelling ""GO AWAY, TROLL"" at this point - it's testament to how painfully invested the viewer is) to the smallest etching on a soldier's helmet. It is such minuscule details which reveal that Jackson's dedication is not just to showy exteriors but in truly bringing to life the spirit of the source novels, and as such, The Return of the King proves peerless.Capturing an audience's interest and sympathies for three vast films in a row would be no easy feat, had the exemplary cast not created some of the most beloved film characters of all time. While keeping tortured protagonist Frodo an engaging and tragic lead instead of simply bug-eyed and annoying is a thankless task, Elijah Wood remains quietly charming enough to master the audience's sympathies throughout. Ian McKellen redefines the word class as noble wizard Gandalf, while mercifully still allowing moments of warm humour to slip through the cracks of his dignified solemnity. Viggo Mortensen's quiet yet ferocious charisma makes his heroic Aragorn a truly powerful and resonant figure, and Sean Astin infuses the wrenching journey of Frodo's noble companion Sam with pulsing emotion and endearing heart, a truly remarkable performance. The forever underrated Andy Serkis generates an enormously powerful performance, riddled with menace, humour, pathos, and exceptional physicality as the viciously obsessive Gollum. Bernard Hill emanates subtle nobility as patriarch Théoden, while David Wenham is truly compelling as discounted Gondorian noble Faramir. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan expand beyond comic relief to true dramatic sentiment as hobbits Pippin and Merry, and Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies continue their comic banter and exhilarating fight scenes as elf Legolas and dwarf Gimli to welcome effect. Similarly, the often overshadowed female cast members more than hold their own despite lack of screen time, as Miranda Otto is rousing and gripping as tenacious noblewoman Eowan, and Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler prove distinguished and mesmerizing as Elven royals Galadriel and Arwen. Such praise could prolong to the extent of the film's succession of endings. Suffice to say, The Return of the King embodies the strengths of a trilogy that, uncontroversially, can be considered some of the greatest filmmaking of all time. A truly stunning melding of exhilarating action, devastating emotional storytelling and sumptuous visuals, The Return of the King proves an engrossing epic of cinematic magic in its most most fulfilling, unpretentious form. Even for those normally dismissive of the fantasy genre, the last of Jackson's cinematic masterpieces is almost sure to enthral and capture the heart as next to no other film can. -10/10

                And so, Jackson fulfills his vision of J.R.R. Tolkien's story of Middle-earth and he does so with breathtaking detail and near-flawless artistic craftsmanship. Both previous entries of Jackson's epic ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy were spectacular achievements. ""Return of the King"" is an eleven Academy Award-winning movie and I suppose it's very worthy of such a title. It pretty much has won all of its Oscars for the entire trilogy, finally scoring big in the Best Picture category. Box office was also incredible, this film is the second biggest hit worldwide, just barely behind James Cameron's superb film ""Titanic"".""Return of the King"" is the conclusion of the trilogy. The stories of Frodo, Gandalf, Sam, Aragorn, and the others comes to a close as the characters all meet their fates. The final battle against the dreaded Sauron begins and there are numerous, almost countless battle sequences throughout the film using combinations of live-action actors in costumes and makeup, and state-of-the-art flawless visual effects created through months of hard work. The giant deranged elephants, trolls, and the sadistic Gollum are all incredibly convincing despite the fact that they are simply an illusion put on the film screen. Sometimes you might be able to guess that they are CGI, but Jackson's skills at directing a medieval battle sequence draws you into the action too much to pay any attention to the detail of the graphics. And you have to look hard to find any possible flaws or weak points.The Lord of the Rings is an amazing film trilogy, definitely one the best, ranking amongst others such as ""Star Wars"". ""Return of the King"" is an amazing achievement as well. Perhaps its only flaw is the excessive running time at nearly four hours in length. Still, that does not make it a disappointment in any way. That is unless you want it to be extremely faithful to Tolkien's original work. For me, it's a great movie.

                A lot of people looking on this page will thoroughly disagree and disregard my comments but I feel justified in saying that the Lord of the Rings trilogy and this final part in particular are possibly some of the most over-rated films of all time! I hasten to add that I do like the films and rate them as very good 7 or 8 out of 10 but I just do not see them as the 10/10 all time greats that other people see them as. I love fantasy stories and films in general, I just find these films to be far less impressive than most people appear to think they are. The main thing in the trilogy I find absolutely impressive is Gollum (Andy Serkis). The motion capture performance by Serkis is genius and the CGI character was the best up to that time. Also Gollum is a great character, hilarious, sometimes creepy and fascinating. Also you cannot fault Christopher Lee as Saruman, Ian McKellen as Gandalf and there are other good performances too.Most people who loved the books or loves this kind of story understandably lap the films up enthusiastically. An epic, massive budget presentation of one of the most famous and loved fantasy stories is somewhat irresistible to anyone who likes fantasy stories at all. However, I was a little bit underwhelmed on my first viewing of the films and have remained so with each viewing. They are not bad films at all. They have great spectacle, have some epic action, some scenes with effective humour or emotion and some fine actors but there is a lot I find disappointing. LOTR would be extremely difficult to adapt to film for anybody and I don't think these films do it as well as they could. There is a lot of time wasted unnecessarily and important aspects of story and character are left out or underdeveloped.I find Peter Jackson generally a far from 100% successful director. His version of King Kong is poor and shows his faults even a lot more than the LOTR trilogy. All these Jackson made films are a bit overblown and a little pretentiously directed. Extremely long shots of characters gazing into camera, at each other or into the distance occur so often it is incredible. A great director does not need words to tell a story or convey emotion and the face and eyes of an actor can be used to huge effect. But most shots of characters without dialogue in this trilogy fail to make me feel anything other than they are wasting time! Frodo (Elijah Wood) especially just gazes or gawps for what seems like ages without making me connect with his feelings and without moving the character or story on at all.CGI is the real king in these films and as impressive as many scenes are, it never thrills as much as the real scenery or real action in some older epics. The epic spectacle is therefore not enough to carry me away on its own, it requires great storytelling. Some great storytelling does occur in these films but I do not feel Tolkein's story or characters are done full justice due to Jackson wasting time on 'pretty', glossy, showy film making. A real efficiency and supreme skill was needed to get the most from the source material and this is lacking. For instance, Return of the King misses out important aspects of Aragorn, Feramir and Saruman's stories and I find Frodo comes across as rather petulant, annoying and lacking heroism. Samwise comes across a lot better.A great villain completes a great story. Sauron appears a feeble 'villain' throughout the trilogy. A flaming eye is not exactly Darth Vader! Tolkein created a villain difficult to show effectively on screen and Jackson's presentation of Sauron fails to convey threat or menace at all. Saruman is a good villain and is brilliantly acted by Christopher Lee but has totally insufficient screen time, particularly in the final story where he goes straight to DVD!Overall The Return of the King is easily the weakest of the trilogy for my tastes featuring faults I have listed above, rather overblown CGI action and an extraordinarily dragged out ending.Yes these films are very good but for me they are nowhere near the classics they are reputed to be or that they could have been if perfectly directed.

                Just like the book it was based on, the third Lord of the Rings movie towers above its siblings and brings the series to a cataclysmic conclusion, in every sense of the word. From its gigantic battle sequences, to its heartbreaking personal moments, Return of the King redefines what is possible in cinema and sets the impossible bar every other masterpiece must be measured against from now on. Clocking in at almost 3 and a half hours in its theatrical cut, it covers most of the material in the book and wins every point for its immensely satisfying coda. Howard Shore gets another two Oscars and Jackson and co are finally paid their dues. I have never been happier on an Oscar night.

                There is no epic like The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. I have never had a better time seeing this movie in theaters. This breathtaking epic, is the third and last installment in The Lord of the Rings. Sam and Frodo are closer and closer to the cracks of Doom while their journey becomes very dangerous along with their guide Gollum helping. Meanwhile the rest of the fellowship try to stop Sauron's army from taking the ring. The movie is pure magical from beginning to end and the characters are all wonderful. Return of the King went very fast for a three and a half hour movie, mostly because I loved it. I have become very obsessed with the trilogy and if you loved the first two Lord of the Rings, you will definitely love the last one as well.Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+

                In an era when filmmakers of mediocre ability can get financing to do grunge slash thrillers or sex-pie college comedies of Farrelly-manque nonsense, this poll serves to illustrate the gratitude of fans everywhere at being served such a luscious 9 course meal of a film. Or 3 of them. At the Director's own insistence, the writing, the production, the editing, the art design, the sound planning, the actors/characters, the costumes, the music, the effects. Everything was delivered until the limits almost gave.None of these and ALL of them are the stars.To say this vote reflects only appreciation of the special effects is to disingenuously shoulder aside the leadership and dedication and commitment from ALL teams required to produce not just one but all three films to such incredible standards of consistency to the books, while pleasing worldwide fans, and new audiences, as well as all ages.Schindler's List was not Spielberg's story by authorship any more than Tolkien's was Jackson's, both borrowed a cultural event, one historical, one literary, story to exploit on the big screen using the appropriate talent. That's what filmmakers do. And if they're smart, they get the right material. I don't think Spielberg could have delivered LOTR. But I have a funny feeling PJ might have come close to SL. Both proved their genius by traveling outside their closest strength positions and moved to new arenas. Both borrowed from past projects and knowledge of film to create the dramatic impacts they engineered in those films.You cannot say because one was historically based then it was by that ilk superior.Schindler's List may be the most sociologically impactful movie ever made, but it was not the best. There was exploitation, and the Nazi's character was colored fancifully, and Schindler was not the spitting image of Liam Neesam, etc etc. You can read history without the women prostituting themselves and children lying in outhouse filth. Spielberg made the same kinds of decisions making that movie Jackson did making rings, but each used ""special effects"" of a different kind. Did Naziism happen in black and white?That anyone would seek to disprove Rings popularity by citing the more proximate (and non-disputed) sociological consciousness raised by SL is gaging on the wrong scale. I would not pay to see SL again, once as enough. But I've paid a dozen times (X3)and for the extended DVD's to relive Tolkien's world, because like those characters ""I believe there's something good in this world worth fighting for"". And Jackson's world gives me and others a place to go to encourage us. The films are about Hope.Wasn't THAT the message from Schindler as well?

                ...and although it loses steam in the middle, the spectacular battle, iconic design work and blistering finale pump it all up to the quality of its fore-films.The film is peppered with cool moments, a dawn raid against the archers of Osgiliath has a total dungeons and dragons feel and Gollum is such a schemer and a villain he's toe-curlingly watchable. The Dead King and co. are a well realised, visually cool bunch of deus ex machina and Gandalf steeling Merry for death is a beautiful moment. The final battle flows extremely well, it's nothing tonally alike to the filthy last stand at Helms Deep, this is trained army vs trained army. The focus of Aragorn's conclusion to be crowned rightfully King is satisfying and the right icing on the cake.Regarding the extended edition, it's made weakest of the three only insofar as the theatrical of Return of the King is the most complete and impressive of the three. However, the opening scenes of Sauron are the most required and missed from the theatrical and I'm in favour of the many endings of this film because after 11 hours of movie, it earns the right to take an hour to draw to a close.

                From my reading the books in school, all the movies were kept as true as possible. And it was like following the books in synchro. The return of the king was the greatest movie of all time, the beautiful land scape's and character builds kept me riveted through out the entire trilogy. Peter Jackson by far right now, is quite possibly the most elite director to come to Hollywood. He is now next to James Cameron and also Cecill B Demile for Oscar wins from a movie. Gaining 11 wins with numerous other awards that has helped mold his career even more. This film is absolutely breath taking in scope as well as the deep camaraderie in the story line where not all soldiers are only made to fight. But they are made to understand life through combat. To see each others struggles and hopes and dreams nearly smashed by an ultimate evil. Yet triumph through poise and audacity, to look evil in the eye and come through with a friends life in one hand, and a sword in the other. A true pinnacle in movie making.

                What a breathtaking end to an epic saga that will go down in cinematic history as the best trilogy that was ever created (if it hasn't already). The culmination of 10 years' work and the final chapter of Peter Jackson fantasy adventure film series, The Return of The King fires on all cylinders, as we follow our favorite middle earth characters in a larger- than-life journey that will lead to the final confrontation between the forces of good and evil. Whereas in FOTR and The Two Towers when we were still learning about our characters and their surroundings, everything about the ring's importance and power is unleashed in this third installment and to great effect.With the exception of maybe only The Godfather Trilogy, the LOTR film series is indisputably the greatest in film history (it was only the second sequel to nab a Best Picture Oscar, the only other being -you guessed it- The Godfather Part II). And what more can actually be said? The breathtaking visuals, the outstanding character development, the epic musical score, gorgeous set designs, the plethora of visually striking creatures - there's never been anything quite like this on screen before. And there never will be again! Never has a film balanced electrifying action and substantial character development so deftly while also staying true to the original source material. It will never cease to amaze me how this was all brought to life. Through this trilogy, Jackson presents us with an unprecedented odyssey of friendship, loyalty, bravery, self-realization and so many other things. In the beginning, we are introduced to a fellowship of 9 individuals who are given the seemingly impossible task of taking the one ring to the blood-curdling world of Mordor with the goal of destroying it and saving middle earth in the process. Over the course of 3 films, our characters learn so much about themselves, about what it means to fight for what you believe in and for something bigger than then yourselves. These themes, and the scale they're presented on, completely transcend the idea of a movie and almost operate on a more biblical and spiritual fashion. And perhaps no film franchise has given us so many memorable characters as LOTR: Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimil, Boromir, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Arwen, Eowyn and countless more. And that's JUST the good guys. We are also given such memorable villains as Gollum, Sauron and Saruman, in addition to the plethora of evil Orcs, Goblins, Demons, Dragons and other horrifying beings. If you think this sounds like a lot, nothing can prepare you for the sheer scope and vast vision of Jackson and his team. The franchise also has some of the most powerful cinematic moments I can recall from the last 40 years (Gandalf yelling ""You Shall Not Pass!"", The Battle of Helms Deep, Sam carrying Frodo up Mount Doom). Iconic doesn't do this franchise justice; it's legendary and it's immortal. It's Lord of the F****** Rings!Above all, Jackson stays true to the major themes and philosophies from the original source material while showcasing his extraordinary cinematic talent and vision. ROTK defines what a ""fantasy"" epic should be and becomes so much more in the process; it's a resonant coming-of-age story and a masterpiece of storytelling and filmmaking. There just aren't enough superlatives for this film. And for this trilogy. And when you do finish it all for the first time, you'll be left sitting there with a feeling of emptiness for having left this magical world but a satisfaction in realizing you just witnessed one of the all-time greatest films and trilogies ever put to celluloid. What a crowning achievement by every single person involved.

                ...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 Fangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson, the director behind the ""goriest movie ever made"" (1992's ""Dead Alive""), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga, which include ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001), ""The Two Towers"" (2002), and Best Picture Oscar-winner ""The Return of the King"" (2003).***Note*** This comment applies to all three movies, as it will be posted at each individual web page.Not since ""Star Wars"" has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books, though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. ""The Lord of the Rings"" is the biggest movie I've ever seen, and there's a whole lot of story, 12+ hours to be exact, and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which, in my view, do push the limits of the ""PG-13"" rating), not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is, and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing, epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get ""into"" Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies, you feel like you're really there, with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too, with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and ""The Enemy,"" who include the brutish Orcs, Moria Orcs, Ringwraiths, and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly, the cast does much more than bring the action to life, but instead live (""live"" is italicized) their parts. Of course, I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way, two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a ""fellowship of the ring."" There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy), and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material, despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. Someone once called ""The Lord of the Rings"" the greatest fantasy epic ever made; they were right.10/10

                It took J.R.R. Tolkien twelve years to complete this epic trilogy. It took Peter Jackson almost ten years to complete the movie adaptation of that trilogy (he'd been working on it since 1997). It's been a long journey, but it was worth it. Every single step.So, this is the one where it all comes to an end: Frodo(Elijah Wood) must conquer his fears in order to fulfill his mission, the destruction of the One Ring; Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), on the other hand, is supposed to accept and embrace his fate, which is to reclaim the throne of Gondor, while all the armies available are fighting against the Dark Lord Sauron's forces. The freedom of Middle Earth is at stake...Like in The Two Towers, character development is pretty much ignored in favor of the visually stunning combats (the 50-minute long battle of Pelennor Fields is breathtaking). Actually, that's the only defect of the theatrical version (rating:9/10) of The Return of the King: at 3 hours and 12 minutes it's, ironically, too short, mostly because of the biggest plot hole ever (what happened to Saruman), a scene which is gloriously restored in the extended edition, which is a must-see if you want the complete story.Now, let's talk about the best thing in the movie: Sean Astin. He already proved he was a great actor in the previous films, but in this one he really shines, giving us a tormented, angry, but loyal character, willing to do anything for his master (fans will never forget this line: ""I can't carry it (the Ring) for you! But I can carry YOU!"", probably the single most moving piece of dialogue in the entire trilogy). Shame the Academy overlooked his astounding performance.Well, at least they didn't overlook the entire movie, each one of its 11 Oscars being fully deserved. The Return of the King isn't just the best picture of 2003, it's among the absolutely best movies of all time.Peter Jackson has written a new, exciting page of cinema history, and we will always be grateful for that.

                ""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" is a terrific demonstration of CGI and special effects made to serve a thrilling story of good vs. evil.I came in fully expecting that the ""Return of the King"" aspect would be the story line that would draw me in the most, but found that was given short shrift with a lot of that left out from the book, given over more to cinemascope-worthy battles that are the best since the early ""Star Wars"" movies. If I hadn't read the book recently, let alone re-read the appendices several times to be sure I was getting the prophesies and genealogy straight, I would never have figured out what was going on with Aragorn as the heir to Isildur, as much of what he does to convince doubters is missing. I also was a bit disappointed in Viggo not quite living up to ""LOTR: The Two Towers,"" but I don't know if it was his acting or the dialog, especially in his ""rally the troops"" a.k.a. ""another Crispin's Day speech,"" or if I found his traveling down the Paths of the Dead less frightening, and less motivated, than in the book. His Elvish-language song at the coronation was a nice touch.Second to the battles, the lighting of the bonfires along the mountain tops was both gorgeous and exciting.I am relieved that Eowyn and Faramir's romance shows will show up in the DVD because the sudden appearance of Arwen with an approving father in Minas Tirith is simply a befuddled resolution to the triangular tensions. I am sympathetic, however, about having to leave some things out in a rushed conclusion due to the length as I did have trouble sitting through to the credits, what with the extensive previews tacked on as well.But the Gollum/Smeagol vs. Frodo and Sam competition was instead the more gripping, perhaps because the power of evil is so intensely represented by the close-up interior and exterior struggles of these almost-four characters trekking to Mordor.I didn't mind the multiple endings that others have complained of as I respected the loyalty to the source material.Howard Shore's music was martial without being bombastic, and Annie Lennox's vocalization fit in surprisingly in the over-the-credits song.(originally written 12/28/2003)

                After years and years of rewatching the best trilogy of all time, I can only say that it was a pity that the extended versions where not in the cinema. Would really enjoy at one point a LOTR marathon in cinema with the extended version. It is amazing what kind of effects and storytelling was put in place for this movie and the whole series together. I can only hope that at one point in time at least another movie like this one, not saying a trilogy, will be done so we can enjoy a true marvelous movie with a grand story and characters. Chapeau to everyone from staff to directors!Other than that, still unbeatable!

                Mr. Jackson has created the perfect ending to an amazing adaptation of the classic literary masterpieces. He has taken an unmanageable array of literary devices and narratives to present us with incredible visual passages, emotional journeys, and seamless blends of new technology and old-fashioned storytelling.Just like its two previous chapters, RTOK is of epic proportions. With the assistance of adept editors, the different story lines are integrated and keep us engaged for nearly 4 hours. We get to the rewarding payoff where all will be resolved.ROTK is a nearly perfect film, and some people might argue that its various endings might lessen the impact of its conclusion. It's hard to walk away from such magnificent storytelling with a simple ending. It's at least interesting to at least explore the many possibilities that such a tale might lead us to.

                How can you give one of the greatest movies in cinema history a 1 or 2 rating? Yes if you are a GOT fan or marvel fan you can do that! By purpose only for bringing your sily movies upper on the list.
Any real cinema fan knows that we will not see a masterpiece like this for years.I read one of reviews somebody said that actors and crew took movie too seriously and this is a weak point 😂

                Coronaboredom made me watch the whole trilogy again last weekend (2021)
And it's just.astonishing to watch these movies knowing that the first one is from 2001!This movie franchise put the bar so high that all threee are still allmost unmatched by anything that's made in the last 20 years, not just the acting, the.atmosphere and the story, but also the special effects are still great and very watchable.Way better than the Hobbit-series that came out 10 years later.For the die-hard LOTR-fans offcourse the movies isn't exactly like the books, but who cares, if you love adventuremovies and D&D-style role playing games these movies are exactly what you want!!They also has their flaws offcourse,, but that's also because of the story itself, some characters are just a bit ""overpowered"" and some events are just a bit ""too.convenient"" like the army of invincible undead who save the day in the end.The movies are also not really easy-watchings, they are long and the directors cuts are even longer.But the dialoqgues are great, and the gloomy atmosphere of.impending doom just grabs you by the throath.Last years the movies got some backlash ofcourse, because the ""woke"" comunity found out that there are zero as in no actors of color in it, except of the Easterlings maybe.I don't see the issue, the ""Middle Earth"" part of that (fantasy) planet has a moderate climate with harsh winters so like on this planet it's logical that the humans who live their are white.There are also no big harbor/seaside cities in the movie and those are the places where merchants of other parts of the planet would go to trade and there weren't many humans in the first place judging by the movie.The ""age of Men"" had just begun, and offcourse Middle-Earth was a war-zone so why go there in the first place..
With hindsight maybe Peter Jackson could have casted more diversity but who knew this planet would turn out like to be big rock filled with whining people...In the end these three movies are still the greatest adventure movies ever made to this day, unmatched and unrivaled, PERIOD!

                Lord of The Rings Return of The King is one of the most universally beloved movies of all time at all the praise it receives could not be more deserved this is an incredible movie that is the definition of how to conclude a trilogy. Lord of The Rings has never been about the battle sequences they are all about the characters and their interactions. Frodo and Sam have some of the best chemistry I've ever seen in a movie they just feel like they are meant to be each other and feel like brothers every time they are on screen. Aragon, Legolas and Gimili are also amazing together not only are they great for producing laughs but they also have a great connection with one and other you see how well they work together and how they have come to trust and love one and other. The constant physiological warfare between Sam and Gollum is made all the more thriller through the opening of this movie which reveals his finding the one ring and in a very disturbing sequence his mental deterioration afterwards. Faramir and his relationship with Theoden is thrilling you always feel for him. The rather odd pairing of Pippin and Gandalf in this movie is also amazing they just feel like each others crutches during their experiences. Though these films have never relied on the battle sequences they've always benefited from them and here they are incredible you feel the stakes because of how well these characters have been developed, you feel the scale of the enemies they are facing and the grittiness of the close quarters combat. This movie contains one of the greatest third acts ever put to film you just know that it's all been building to this and your heart cannot stop beating. The final showdown between Middle-Earth and Saurons army is extremely satisfying especially to see Aragon take his rightful place as king and to see all these different species truly come together as one. Another inspiring sequence is when Sam and Frodo finally arrive at Mount Doom it feels like the perfect culmination of the story arc and seeing these characters succeed despite being all but broken because of it shows us that they're flesh and blood characters with everything to lose. Now I know it's popular to complain about the long ending but it really works it helps to put the events of the entire trilogy into perspective and the final scene with the Hobbits and Gandalf leaves me in tears every single time again because of how feel we have come to know these characters but also let's you know that they have further adventures ahead of them after the credits roll. Return of The King truly is one of the greatest movies ever made there is not one single flaw with it and is the definition of not only how to conclude a trilogy but how to do a movie as a whole. A+-100%

                I still get goosebumps every time I watch this movie. I still at awe with how engaging the story is on screen, how good the visuals have held up even after all this time, and still get emotional with everything going on. It's a wonderful conclusion to an amazing trilogy directed by Peter Jackson, and I wish for this movie to be cherished for years to come!

                Where do I start? Those who have already seen this movie don't need a review, and those who haven't will probably never look at my review given the multitudes of others to choose from. So, I'll just say how this movie personally affected me, as a fan of the books and of movies in general. I absolutely loved the original film, Fellowship of the Ring, and did enjoy the Two Towers, though not as much. I loved the emotion of the original (subtle scenes like Frodo's long decision-making boatside scene at the end), and found that the Two Towers was great in action and scope but as a result sort of put character development and characters' feelings into the background. But this makes sense, as the book it was based on dealt more with action and also had the burden of introducing half a dozen important new characters. Return of the King, however, is just simply fantastic. I try to avoid statements like ""gets everything right"", and ""I enjoyed every minute of it"", but in this case, it's true. I was so moved at the presentation of this film that I couldn't help getting misty at the end, despite knowing exactly what would happen (based on the books of course). I credit this to not only the great performances but also the stirring music (Annie Lennox's moving ""Into the West"" is a beautiful tune and perfectly echoes the sentiments of the film's themes). And also, I couldn't help being moved knowing that it was now all over, and there will probably never be another Lord of the Rings epic of this magnitude in my lifetime (and rightfully so). I just felt like I was saying goodbye to old friends.  The movie, although beginning with an important flashback, begins immediately where the second film concluded, and every character has a conclusion. The main part of this movie that I loved is the simple fact that no character is shortchanged; the main characters have their own moments of screen time and good dialogue, from Gandalf telling Pippin what beautiful peace awaits him if he should die in battle, to Sam heroically carrying an exhausted Frodo on his own shoulders through sheer determination. It's all done well, and it takes its time to do it, which I wouldn't have any other way. Whereas Fellowship of the Ring dealt more in emotion and character development and the Two Towers was more hurried and action packed, I was delighted to see that return of the King found a perfect balance between the two and devotes ample time to both. The battle scenes are the grandest in scope and awe, and the highs and lows of sheer emotion are quite gracefully handled as well. And when everything is said and done and the battles are over, there's still a journey home for some of the characters and a good amount of movie left to enjoy. But everything moves along so smoothly, it's sometimes easy to forget that it's a 3 hour and fifteen minute ride. If there isn't action going on, there are scenes of pending action or drama at an almost nonstop rate, making sure that there's something to stop even the most restless from becoming bored. If for some reason you've chosen my review out of the many available, let me at the very least leave you with this, and it will hopefully help you to decide to see it if you haven't yet:  As the finale of a trilogy, this is the masterstroke that ties everything together and is successful on a multitude of levels. It's action packed and stirringly heartfelt at the same time. And finally, from someone who loves the books, I can say that although some omissions were made, the story doesn't falter as a result and the film as a whole was handled in about the most graceful, pleasing way I can imagine. It is, quite honestly, a cinematic masterpiece and a major accomplishment. I left teary eyed, happy for having been thrilled for more than 3 hours, and also quite sad that I don't have another of these films to look forward to.

                I first watched the LOTR Trilogy when I was 13 y/o. It was my father's favorite movie. Back then, I was not able to understood fully what it is all about but I liked it. I did not love it like I loved Harry Potter back then, but I liked it.Entering High School, I have gotten the chance to re-watch the whole trilogy again and again and again, and this time I absolutely loved it. I became obsessed with the story. Tolkien, created a beautiful world, and wrote about this amazing characters. We see each of the characters' growth as we followed their journey up to the end.The cinematography of all movies are spot on. The sound was done beautifully and the actors gave life to one of the most-loved characters of all time.The Return of The King concludes the story of Middle-Earth, having peace back in their world. We know that CGI can both be the angel and the demon at the same time but with this film, it was done just right. This truly elevated my standard with films. The quality was spectacular and truly a timeless piece.

                Let me start by telling this, I think this movie is the best movie ever made. There are different reasons for that conclusion and part of it certainly is due to the buildup this movie had, with the first 2 other movies. I think this movie is much better than both of them though. It pretty much everything a movie needs to have IMO. It has good storytelling, great characters, outstanding visuals and good pacing (which is something I found the other 2 movies to be missing).What can be said about the story obviously is, that it is giant. There are stories that take place on a smaller scale, where only small things are at risk and I am not saying, these stories are worse (in fact, if they're done right, they can be better), but I also like stories that tackle a giant, worldwide danger. This is what all of the LOTR movies do, they deal with something that threatens pretty much the entire world. The good storytelling in it is that we find different people in this situation and they all come together through some circumstances (which, of course, happens in the first movie, not this one). What we get in this movie, is those characters working together, to solve this one problem. They all do serve a purpose in solving the problem and the story does a good job to show, why they do. That is good storytelling, that is how you tell a giant story right. And also, the way it ended is great. Then we have the characters. We have a lot of different characters in LOTR. We have people like Aragorn, who are in self doubt (although this isn't really present in the books. I think it's a great addition to the story), which they manage to lose in the end and which makes them get to the peak of their power. This is what we get to see in Return of the King. We finally see Aragorn, actively deciding that he will take his rightful throne and he does what he needs to do, to deserve it. On the other hand, we have characters that are like Legolas, the knight in shining armor kind. We do also have crazy people (Denethor), we have people like Sam, who are just very loyal. What I am getting to is that those characters all seem believable to me, which is what makes a good character. The best example would be Frodo, who also is in a constant struggle, because of the ring. His story is a great story about a guy that is not big enough for the task he's up against, which is a sad story. The good thing on that part is that everyone else got their happy end, but Frodo didn't, because Frodo basically failed. This characters are interesting.So, let's talk about the visuals. My favorite scene of the trilogy (from the cinematic standpoint) is in this movie. It is, when the riders of Rohan attack the Ork army in front of Minas Tirith. It is just a very beautiful scene. From an artistic standpoint, it is brilliantly made. What gives this scene a lot of power, is the horn that announces it. When you hear that horn, you have a slight idea of what you're going to get. You get the fact that Rohan is arriving, but to see it play out on the screen, to see them ride down those hills, being bombarded by arrows and crushing through the pikes of the Orks, was the most beautiful thing, I have ever seen on a screen. If I have ever been close to an orgasm while watching a movie, it was during this scene, because this scene, is epic.Now to the pacing. This movie does pacing in a better way than the other 2. What makes the difference is that noting in Return of the King seems irrelevant to the story. Yes, it is long. But the length this movie has is filled up with relevant stuff and everything seems very important, which is why it doesn't stretch as much as the other 2 movies do. It feels shorter, although it is massively longer. This is quite an impressive thing.Now, those are my reason for liking this movie. I truly think that it probably isn't the best in any of the categories I mentioned, but I think it combines them in the best way. The complete package of The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is bigger and better than that of any other movie, which makes it the best movie I have ever watched. If there was any way to give it more than 10/10, I would definitely do that, but I will have to stick to a 10/10.

                The ongoing chronicle of THE LORD OF THE RINGS reaches its spectacular conclusion with THE RETURN OF THE KING. I'm certain many people share my belief that 99% of movie trilogies ~and some long running Tv shows~ went out with a whimper instead of a bang, but THE RETURN OF THE KING surpasses all expectations. I'll go so far as to declare it the finest trilogy in motion picture in history ~I don't count THE GODFATHER series because the belated third installment fell below the standards of its two predecessors.J. R. R. Tolkien's influence on all strata of society is inestimable. The seventysomething Oxford professor and author became an unlikely counterculture voice when young people embraced his fantastical works in droves during the 1960's. In popular music, Tolkien was a muse for some of Led Zeppelin's best known songs (""Ramble On; Misty Mountain Hop"")....and their album artwork ~check out Led Zeppelin IV~ is undeniably Tolkienesque. And finally, where would the STAR WARS saga be without ""Lord Of The Rings""? Has anyone else suspected that Luke Skywalker and Obi-wan Kenobi are really intergalactic versions of Frodo Baggins and Gandalf the Grey?

                This movie was simply fantastic. Action packed, suspenseful, and yet still enchanting. Acting in the movie is terrific, especially from McKellen and Mortenson. Peter Jackson reached new heights with this masterpiece, completely deserving the best picture Oscar.The plot follows the continuing adventures of the disbanded Fellowship of the Ring, in their quest to destroy the powerful One Ring. Frodo Baggins, Sam Gamgee, and their guide Gollum are on a quest to the Cracks of Doom, while the rest of the Fellowship is preparing for war with Sauron (forger of the One Ring) and his soldiers.It this complex plot that is part of the reason that this film is so good. The CGI is breathtaking, especially for 2003. Everything in the movie looks lifelike. The cinematography, in the movie is astonishing and sweeps one off of one's feet. Battle scenes are brilliantly choreographed, intense and high-octane.I know I don't seem too exited about this movie, but this movie is terrific. If you haven't seen this movie, see it. It is a classic, and one of the best films out there.

                STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsIn the concluding adaptation of Tolkien's trilogy,Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) head with Gollum to Mount Doom to dispose of the troublesome ring,whilst the rest of the gang brace themselves for the final battle for Middle Earth.Having put my achy,fidgety,restless bum through the ordeal of the first two movies,I found it only fitting to watch the concluding part (which would be the longest part at a whopping 201 minutes!!!)Luckily,I happened to be watching this one on DVD as opposed to at the cinema and was therefore free to press the pause button at any moment I deemed appropriate in order to take a break and watch it entirely at my own pace.I would certainly only deem it advisable to watch this at a cinema that has a break for refreshments halfway through.I think my school of thought all along really has been that of a fair few others.If you were a fan of the books,then these movies will probably be the equivalent of a wet dream come to life.If you have never read any of the books,however,it's all likely to emerge as a big overblown,self indulgent affair,as I think sadly has been the case with me.The ending especially here is a real nerve grater,as it appears to come again and again after over three hours of patient sitting and observing,only to keep droning on that bit longer.Given the heavy handedness of it all anyway,it just makes for even more of a labourious experience.In the movie's favour,it is a bit more emotionally involving than the last two and manages to draw you in to the plot a bit more,although that may just be because you know a bit more what to expect and so you've resigned yourself to it that bit more.The battle scenes and cinematography in general are certainly nothing to sniff at either.This is,giving away from some laughable and not entirely convincing acting indeed.But,given how little the story had already engrossed me to this point,it's all a bit too little too late.It may have reached #4 on the IMDB top 100,but given I don't know a 'hobbit from a racehorse',it's best use in my favour would seem to be as the ultimate late-night cure for insomnia.**

                ""The final battle for Middle-earth begins as Frodo and Sam, led by Gollum, continue their dangerous mission toward the fires of Mount Doom in order to destroy the 'One Ring'. Aragorn struggles to fulfill his legacy as he leads his outnumbered followers against the growing power of the Dark Lord Sauron, so that the Ring-bearer may complete his quest,"" according to the DVD sleeve description, this final installment was the ""Winner of 11 'Academy Awards'."" The conclusion of writer/director Peter Jackson's majestic realization of J.R.R. Tolkien's good versus evil epic adventure ""The Lord of the Rings"" continues to inspire awe; ""The Return of the King"" is another state-of-the-art motion picture, with the expected mind-blowing special effects and battle scenes. As you'll see (or not), this chapter falters somewhat, after the more tightly-constructed ""Two Towers"". But, at this point, criticism is pointless. In conclusion: ******** The Fellowship of the Ring (12/10/01) Peter Jackson ~ Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom ********** The Two Towers (12/5/02) Peter Jackson ~ Viggo Mortensen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Andy Serkis********* The Return of the King (12/1/03) Peter Jackson ~ Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, Billy Boyd ********* The Lord of the Rings (12/10/01-12/1/03) Peter Jackson ~ Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Ian McKellen

                Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy comes to its epic conclusion in fine style: Frodo and Sam enter Mordor while the Battle of the Pelennor Fields begins, largely as a feint to draw Sauron's army away to allow the Ringbearer clear passage to Mount Doom. Following the Ring meeting its fate, all story lines are brought to their resolutions in a half hour or so of winding down.Jackson's visualisation of what happens inside Mount Doom is faithful to, and improves upon, Tolkien's source - once again, Tolkien threw away one of his set pieces in less than a page. The one false note is Gollum's final expression - I would have expected agony rather than ""Blimey! That's a bit of a surprise!"" There are at least five separate end-pieces - the Fellowship reunited, Aragorn's coronation, the return to the Shire, the Grey Havens, and Sam's return home (it is possible to argue at least a couple more). The film could have been ended on any of these, and there are those who argue that it should have been. But although the film could have ended there, the story could not, and credit to Jackson for adding a half hour capstone to a ten hour film in order to properly resolve all that should have been resolved.I feel this particularly strongly since this closing section contains two of my favourite moments. One is the moment in the tavern - the four Hobbits, traumatised by war, sit together in silence in stark contrast to the trivial carousing in the opposite bookend tavern scene in Fellowship. And the other is Frodo's final look back. If Elijah Wood never delivers another moment on screen as powerful as that one (and I'm sure he will), that is enough.A towering achievement in all respects.

                It's REALLY good. Every single thing about this movie is cool. It's my number one favourite movie of all time. ( Well actually, the entire TRILOGY together is my favourite number one movie of all time. ) There's no swearing or nudity. I still don't recommend it for the younger audience because there are some slightly frightening scenes, though. But anybody over eleven shouldn't be bothered. I don't recommend it for arachnophobia, because it might give them a heart attack. Anyways, this movie has an excellent beginning and a wonderful ending. And everything in the middle is great, too. BY ALL MEANS RENT IT, but make sure you watch the two first movies first.

                Nothing is perfect if you think about it. Whatever you grasp at, you will always find a flaw. I'm not going to exaggerate, so I will say that ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" (2003) is no exception. But consider this. This is a movie that is the third film in a series. The direction is brilliant, the script adapted to near perfection. The characters from the book are portrayed by the actors magnificently on the big screen. They are chosen down to the smallest detail. Those that Peter Jackson /the director/ thought should have been changed a little, have been changed for the better. The music is........ GREAT!!!People, enough. The movie is almost 4 hours and it doesn't feel like it.Please tell me, give me an example of a movie that meets the above criteria and I'll buy you something.No questions asked: 10/10.

                While not strictly related to the books, I must mention that earlier this year when I went to England one of my destinations was Oxford. While I Oxford I went and had a beer at Tolkien's pub, visited Tolkien's house (20 Northmoor Avenue, there is a plaque on the house that identifies it as his house) and paid a visit to his gravestone. Tolkien was a professor of English literature at Oxford and it shows in his writings. As mentioned previously, he borrowed as lot of ideas from the many books that he had read and incorporated it seamlessly into his epic.It is said that Tolkien hated Shakespeare and considered his writings unoriginal and contrived. One thing he points at is Macbeth where Macbeth is told that he cannot be killed by one of woman born. This meant that it was only McDuff, who was born by cesarean, that could kill him. This, Tolkien though, was rubbish, and wrote into The Lord of the Rings a concept that he thought was much better, that is that the Witchking of Agmar could not be killed by any man, and it was Eowyn, the daughter of Theodren, that ends up slaying him. Personally, I think this is just as contrived, but Tolkien's dispute with Shakespeare can be left for another day.As with the opening of the Two Towers we are introduced to Theodren, a king driven mad by the power of Saruman, in Return of the King we are introduced to another mad ruler, the Steward of Gondor. Gondor does not have a king, and has not had a king for a very long time. Instead the land is ruled by the Stewards, but there is an anticipation that a king will return and take the throne, and this is something that the Steward does not want happening. He has become corrupted by power, and the only way that he is able to let go is through death.In Lord of the Rings, power corrupts, and corruption leads to madness. We see this clearly with Gollum. He finds the ring and in finding the ring is immediately entrapped by its power. Bilbo has pity on Gollum, and in the end so do we. His life is corrupted by one desire and that is to possess 'his precious' the one ring. The ring dominates his entire life, and he ends up hiding in a dark cave staring at his precious. However when he loses it his life is destroyed. It is at this point that even we, the reader, pity him, because we know that his life has no meaning beyond possession of the ring. This drives him to then search for the ring, and this greed that has corrupted his heart pretty much makes him untrustworthy. The only reason he helps Frodo is to attempt to get back his precious.There is a point where Gollum appears to have beaten his demon, and truly understands Frodo as a friend, but this changes when Frodo is forced to betray Gollum, but what Gollum does not realise, and never realises, is that Frodo did this to save his life. However Gollum is an individual that is driven by one obsession and it is this obsession that drives him to separate Sam from Frodo. He knows that the only thing standing between him and his precious is Sam, and he does what he can to get rid of Sam. However, as mentioned previously, it is Sam's undying loyalty to Frodo that drives him, and even when Frodo sends him away, Sam always remains there, ready to step up and save his friend.

                ""The Return of the King"" is certainly not the strongest of Tolkien's trilogy, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" blows both of the others away, but it is, in the novels, a considerable step up from the slop of ""The Two Towers."" This film series is different--""The Return of the King"" is the worst.There are two gigantic, absolutely unforgivable and completely and utterly wrong changes made from the novel that absolutely kill this film: 1. Frodo's madness ends when Golem takes the ring and then Golem falls into the fire, but the film forces Frodo to continue his madness and push Golem in. WRONG. 2. Samwise would NEVER leave Frodo, but the film has him head back down the mountain. WRONG. Not only are they differences from Tolkien, but these are changes that work against the story in which they fit and that is why they are so egregious.The production is mostly the same as the previous two in other aspects, with the exceptions that Ian McKellen's performance of Gandalf the White is annoying and nowhere near as good as Gandalf the Grey and that as he is given more to do, Sean Astin completely outshines the rest of the cast. It's also notable that this film has no appearances by Saruman, which cuts out the wonderful, charismatic performance that Christopher Lee has otherwise given--he was, in my opinion, the best casting choice of the entire series, with the only possible exception of Viggo Mortensen's perfect Aragorn.It's still a fantastic film, because Tolkien on a less-than-perfect day wrote a novel far beyond what most writers will even dream of being capable of writing, but this production's changes are absolutely unforgivable. The worst of the series, contrary to what the Oscars said.And how in the world can Howard Shore deserve two Oscars for one score that really wasn't all that impressive to begin with? And how can Peter Weir be denied AGAIN?

                In 2022 my plan was to review both the ""Lord of the Ring"" trilogy of Peter Jackson (2001 - 2003) and the two ""Nibelungen"" movies of Fritz Lang (1924), the reason being that both are ultimately based on the German ""Song of the Nibelungs"" and / or the Scandinavian ""Völsunga saga"". The ""Lord of the Ring"" novel by Tolkien (Jackson) and the Nibelungen opera-cycle by Wagner (Lang) functioned to a greater or lesser extent as an intermediate station with respect to these adaptations.As if they had heard about my plan, right at the start of 2022 Dutch television broadcasted al three episodes of the ""Lord of the Ring"". You can only admire the courage of Peter Jackson, because he was taking an enormous risk. How to involve all those that had not read the book in this labyrinthine story without rousing the indignation of those that had read the book (and often loved it) about leaving out too much detail?Jackson proved to be up to the task in a marvelous manner and brought the fantasy genre to the next level. Twenty years ago the computer generated images (cgi) used by Jackson were nothing less than revolutionary.In his review Roger Ebert remarked that in comparison with the novel the ""sword and sorcery"" element in the movie was emphasized too much. It was too much of ""The adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938, Michael Curtiz & William Keighley) and too little of ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939, Victor Fleming). To translate this remark to the actual characters of the story. In the novel the Hobbits are realy the central characters while in the movie they are the weak spot of the group that have to be defended (in flashy action sequences of course) by the other members of the fellowship.There is a grain of truth in this comment. On the other hand, if you invest heavily in cgi and takes the fantasy genre to the next lever (as stated earlier in this review) you want some action in return, don't you?I called the story labyrinthine and indeed there are many species and races involved. The essence of the story is however rather clear.It is a story about the struggle between good and evil.The forces of the good (Hobbits, Elves, Dwars, Men) cooperate in a fellowship and are learning to appreciate each other more and more as the story unfolds.The evil as represented by the ring (lust for power) is not limited to certain characters. Anyone can in principle be infected by it. In effect there are characters that are evil in the trilogy, but had been good in earlier era's of the Tolkien story (not covered by the Jackson trilogy).""The return of the King"" is the last episode of the Ring trilogy. It is amazing that after the first two episodes Jackson is still capable of surprising his spectators. The battle at Pelennor fields in ""The return of the King"" surpasses the battle at Helm's deep in ""The two towers"", which was already taking your breath away.In the general remarks about the trilogy as a whole I defended the balance that Jackson has kept between action scenes and the Tolkien story. This does however not apply to the bombastic speeches preceding the action scenes, that irritated me more and more.Also in the general remarks I praised the computer generated images (CGI) that were state of the art at the time of release. In the scene in ""The return of the King"" in which Gandalf enters the city of Minas Tirith for the first time it striked me how well these cgi were integrated in and synchronised with the life action.While Frodo was the lead character in the first episode and Aragorn in the second, in the final episode the two lead characters were well matched. An improvement! On the other hand the character of Smeagol / Gollem is less interesting in ""The return of the King"" because his good (Smeagol) side is nearly non existent and he becomes the rather unidimensional bad Gollem.In ""The fellowship of the Ring"" Aragorn has a romance with the elf Arwen. In ""The two towers"" Eowyn, a noblewoman of Rohan, feels attracted to Aragorn. Because you expect that the battle against the evil Sauron ultimately will be won by the good forces, the big question becomes which of these two romances shall eventually come to fruition? Jackson answers this question, but in my opinion quite in a rushed way. Especially the story of Eowyn is rushed, but maybe this is less so in the extended edition of the film.Talking about Eowyn, in a MacBeth like scene she kills the Witch King of Angman, who imagined himself save on the battle field because he could not be killed by a man (just like MacBeth feels safe because no man born of woman can kill him).One of my favourite scenes towards the end is the scene in wich the Hobbits are back in the Shire, having a pint in a pub. This is the kind of life they have been fighting for, but after all they have gone through they are no longer capable of enjoying it. This realy is a scene in the spirit of Tolkien, who fought in the First World War and was of the opinion that in a war there is no winner and only losers.

                All of peter Jackson's film adaptation's of Jrr Tolkien's tell a tale of hope counter balanced with greed. And as the series concludes with Lord of the rings the return of the king the hope pays of for the heroes as Frodo and Sam finally destroy the ring despite the attempts to kill and tempt them. Many characters go through deep spiritual changes and somehow Jackson puts all these tales together without rushing the movie along. Among other things the movie is also a tale of good vs evil and as with most good vs evil movies the good win. Despite a few minor flaws such as focusing on the glory of war and not the horror. (If the movie was about a historical battle it would probably be a tragic tale and not a heroic tale.)But all in all the masterful tale cancels out the few flaws.

                Overall, I am disappointed, though not surprised, by the negative criticism of this movie. Indeed, this criticism exceeds the offering of alternative viewpoints and the expression of other cinematic possibilities and sinks into the realm of bitter invective. So many armchair critics are currently competing with avid Tolkien, Jackson, and movie fans alike in order to espouse the ""true"" value of Peter Jackson's landmark movie trilogy. For it is a landmark event in cinema history based on its sheer size and careful attention, praise and evisceration apart. The issue that greatly irritates me and pushes me to write is that many of the negative reviewers on this website have such limited room in their imagination that they cannot conceive of a world outside their own narrow framework. I find that a most sad reality in light of the legacy of Tolkien, Jackson, and all good story-tellers -- to create, to engender, and to nourish the growth of any and all imaginative ventures.The problem with imagination is that it is an individual event, a unique subjective experience that a single person experiences completely alone. Those who enter into the realm of Art, Fiction, Fantasy, and any degree of Story-telling agree (willingly or no) to take that personal act of creation and primal nature and share it with the community of human beings, each of whom has his or her own imaginative context. It is a bold act of sacrifice, self-confidence, and faith (spiritual, one could argue) to thrust the contents of one's subjective reality into (to borrow from Douglas Adams) the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash. People who do so deserve respect for the mere creative act, the ability to foist forward what they believe is true. From Homer to Bill O'Reilly, this concept of personal creation, what Tolkien called Sub-Creation, is the essence of modern human existence, and we owe it to each other to respect the right to creation history has granted us.Therefore, in defense of both Tolkien (whom some on this website have maligned) and Jackson (whom many have maligned), I forward that both are imaginative creators in their own right, with different and completely acceptable offerings to the world. Those who cannot tolerate either for ""mediocre writing"" or ""atrocious film-making"" should offer forth their literary or cinematic offspring instead of cunningly-worded diatribes of their deep dissatisfaction with all that does not conform to their inner reality. Then, we few who believe in and trust the creative ability of all will be able to see how those critical inner realities (so authoritative in exposition) match up with the rest of our perceptions.Tolkien was an enormously talented, intelligent, and imaginative man, one whose stories, though unpolished by experience, still managed to attract a worldwide audience and devoted following with their luster. Jackson's movies took the sheen and inherent value of Tolkien's stories and placed it in a visual medium, a place where fans of LOTR could witness and love the events and people they held so dear. Of course Tolkien's story is imperfect; of course Jackson's movies aren't as full as we wish them to be. Their great successes are that they still manage to capture our imagination, to move us, to take genuine truth and isolate it in a world outside our ken, a place where we see ourselves better against a foreign backdrop. Both have created and done so masterfully, with the intuitive grasp that is termed ""genius."" Tolkien would have had much at issue with Jackson's movies, where plot incongruities, lapsed character development, and visual splendor overshadow the philological and melancholic overtones of his book. Jackson admits he finds much at issue with Tolkien's book, including a lack of clear character motivation, extended and largely extraneous dialog, and heightened language not suited for Hollywood. But Tolkien, despite his perfectionist griping and loathing for any film version of his book, would respect Jackson for continuing the act of creation, for taking his modern-day mythology and spreading it to as many people as possible. Jackson has taken the beauty, the scope, the complexity, the richness, and the loss that permeate Middle-Earth and shared those leitmotifs with the world. Tolkien's characteristic ""niggling"" would have prevented any such attempt (even Jackson's), but in the end, his heritage lives on in beautifully conceived and executed films.I do not ask others to stifle their opinions of this movie or any other. Indeed, continue to express the direst and bleakest of your frustrations with the creative power of others, as it may lead you to actually do some creation yourself. Remember though, that the great evils of history, from Satan to Hitler to Sauron, are never capable of creation -- only twisting, mutilating, mocking, deforming, and misapplying. Be open to the vision of others and what they have to offer, especially when that offering comes in the virtuosic shape of Tolkien's writing or Jackon's movies. Look for the True in the Secondary and how it manifests itself everywhere once you recognize it.This movie receives a 10 from me because it not only maintains incredible faithfulness to Tolkien's themes (and yes, events may deviate in completely separate and dissimilar media) but it asks intelligent viewers to look deeper into the circumstances of its own creation and beauty. From the loyalty of Sam and the weight of epic history to the sacrifice of Arwen and the never-completely-won nature of war, Jackson's movies capture the essence and heart of Tolkien's tale, with the benefit of the director's own imaginative fruit as well. The world owes Mr. Jackson its gratitude, as he has created another world and another reality that so many can, do, and will cherish.One final word: There are few who would not rather be wandering in a far green country rather than dwelling in their own Circles of the World.

                Before I started college, I watched a bunch of DVDs, including all the original versions of Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. I liked part 1: ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" and part 2: ""The Two Towers"" was not the best of the trilogy, but at least everything was set up for this movie - the final chapter in the trilogy! Back when I saw this for the first time on DVD, this was the third best movie ever made (now this is the 4th best movie ever made with ""The Godfather: Part II"" taking that spot, another movie I plan on watching in the future) and this is the best action movie ever made according to this website. I definitely agree - all the action sequences are breathless! However, the very last 20 minutes of this film were too slow for me - but at least that meant that all good things must come to an end, huh? It also shows that the three parts had a connection which flowed very nicely: starting at the bottom, then going up to the climax, and then going back down again.Before you watch this movie, I must warn you that this movie is 3 hours and 20 minutes long! Here's my plan: watch a part a day; this will make watching ""Lord of the Rings"" more exciting! And be sure that you're watching the original movies first. If you like DVDs and watching action films, then these movies are right for you.

                'The Lord of The Rings' by J. R. R Tolkien is probably the most eloquent, elaborate and seminal piece of fiction ever written. The Saga is 6 Books long, a rich narrative with Maps, Poems and Ballads, which is brought to life by the auteur Peter Jackson in his Lord of The Rings Trilogy.The Lord of The Rings is the fable of Frodo Baggings and his misadventures leading finally to the destruction of the One Ring of Power. It is a tale of Friendship, Loyalty, Betrayal, Politics, War, and much more - An Epic of our Time.Peter Jackson through his Trilogy pays homage to Tolkien. Jackson is the Pupil and Tolkein is the Master, and the Trilogy is Jackson's reverence to Tolkien. He through his artistic genius gives colour to this fictitious world of Dwarves, Elves, Men, Hobbits, Orcs, Nazgûl's and The Dark Lord. He gives face to its various people, and brings to screen their tribulations, their emotions, their misgivings, their endeavours and its outcomes.The Trilogy is divided into 3 Parts - 'The Fellowship of The Ring', 'The Two Towers' and 'The Return of The King'. The films portray the adventures of the hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) of the Shire and the Fellowship which was convened in the Council of Elrond under Lord Elrond (Hugo Weaving) in Rivendell. The Fellowship consisted of the Hobbits Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin), Peregrin Took (Billy Boyd) and Meriadoc Brandybuck (Dominic Monaghan), the Elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), the Dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), the Wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), and of the race of Men Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Boromir (Sean Bean). These 9 compromised the Fellowship who embarked from Rivendell on a quest to destroy The One Ring in the Fires of Mount Doom where it was yielded by Sauron 'The Dark Lord' (Alan Howard), the only place where it can be undone. The destruction of The One Ring ensures the destruction of Sauron. The Fellowship eventually splits up and Frodo continues the quest with his loyal companion and friend Sam and the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis). Meanwhile, Aragorn, heir in exile to the throne of Gondor, along with Legolas, Gimli, Boromir, Merry, Pippin and the wizard Gandalf, unite to save the Free People of Middle-earth from the forces of Sauron and rally them in the War of the Ring to aid Frodo by distracting Sauron's attention. The saga ends with the destruction of The Ring along with The Dark Lord, Aragorn being anointed King of Gondor and the Hobbits retiring back to the Shire. In the Shire, Frodo completes the account of his and Bilbo's (Ian Holm) Adventures and undertakes the journey to the Undying Lands on an Elven Ship leaving Middle Earth along with Lord Elrond, Gandalf and an old and senile Bilbo.Each film of Peter Jackson's Trilogy is approximately 3 hours long (The Director's Cut being 4 Hours). Despite being protracted, Peter Jackson manages to keep the viewer enthralled and on the edge of his seat during the whole viewing. Despite this, Jackson couldn't cover the whole range of Tolkien's work. On reading Tolkien's books, one realises, a myriad of events have not been depicted in the films. To give an example, The Wild Men of The Woods 'Drúedain' haven't been portrayed in the films nor have they received mention. The Chief of the Drúedain guided King Theoden's Army of Rohirrim through the Secret Pass of Stonewain Valley to avoid being attacked by the Orcs so that they could safely reach Minas Tirith for aid. This event is described by Tolkien in the Chapter 'Ride of The Rohirrim' in book 5. In another example, the Hobbits journey through the Old Forest and how they were assisted by Tom Bombadil. This too has been skipped in the films.Jackson has taken certain Creative Liberties while creating these films (Most probably, I reckon for emphatic effect). Jackson at certain instances has strayed from Tolkien's work and imposed his own ideas into the narrative. For example, in the films, it is Arwen (Liv Tyler) who rescues Frodo from the Nazgûl's after he was stabbed on the Tower of Amon Sul and brings him to Rivendell where he is healed by the Elves. However, in Tolkien's narrative, it is the elf Glorfindel who assists Frodo reach Rivendell in time. Another such instance is in regards to 'Narsil' - The Sword That Was Broken. According to Jackson's Films, the Shards of Narsil were kept safe in Rivendell until they were reforged into Andúril, and was brought to Aragorn by Lord Elrond himself. In Tolkien's work, the shards of Narsil are passed down as heirloom by the heirs of Isildur, the last owner being Aragorn. Before the Fellowship departs from Rivendell, Narsil is reforged into Andúril and is carried by Aragorn.If he were alive I do not know how Tolkien would react to these changes in the narrative. However, despite these creative liberties by Jackson, his Trilogy is, till date, the best adaption of Tolkien's work.The impeccable Casting of characters is what makes the Trilogy live up to the hype. Ian MacKellen and Andy Serkis have to be specially mentioned for their portrayal of Gandalf and Gollum respectively. Jackson has even managed to include poems and ballads from Tolkien's narrative into the films in the form of Songs. These songs are backed up by a brilliant Music Composition which is surreal and mystifying. Apart from these, it's the Visual Effects which make the film truly stand out.The Trilogy truly does justice to Tolkien's genius. It is nothing short of a Masterpiece. The 11 Academy Award wins by the Third Film of the Trilogy -'Return of The King', proves the same. With these 11 wins, it ties with Ben-Hur and Titanic for the most awarded Film in Academy History, a feat in it's own. Today, nearly 2 decades after the release of the last instalment, the Trilogy has attained a Cult status among fans and its popularity keeps on waxing. The Trilogy just might prove to be one of the few works of art that stand the test of time.A Review by -

                Frodo, Sam and Gollum continue their quest for Mordor to destroy the one ring while the Battle for Middle Earth rages on.The final part of Peter Jackson's epic trilogy was at the time, the highest grossing film ever to grace our screens and up until this film, fan hype and speculation was rightfully anticipating how the magician Jackson would conclude the wonderfully courageous adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's novel.The previous release, The Two Towers, was showcased by an eccentric display by the director, orchestrating a once more beautifully cinematic approach to scenery and balancing it with a blend of tight and exciting war and fantasy concepts. He proved The Fellowship was no fluke and maintaining his flow in the sequel, the New Zealander was able to carry forth this momentum into the final part with the same vigour and energy as his previous two smashes. There are certainly cases here for the best shots of the entire trilogy. When Frodo is walking slowly and there is a huge spider looming makes great tension but, on a personal level, the best part of the entire series comes near to the end when Frodo and Sam are so very close to banishing the ring for good, and with one simple close shot, Jackson captures Frodo's feelings of desire and madness, which makes for a heart stopping and riveting twist.Peter Jackson has certainly taken the magic of the novels and twisted and shot them into fan's favourites. The complexity of the battle sequences, the close eye upon constant political and action ideologies and weaving a tight knot around such a huge crew is a fantastic achievement and is only bettered by the fact he has made the legendary books into films for anyone of any age, for anytime of the year and for any situation. There is humour, romance, action, war, drama and significantly a wonderful sense of escapism with the fantasy genre, astounding stuff to recapture the critically acclaimed mind of J.R.R Tolkien's work.One huge input into the success which still has fans in awe is the CGI Andy Serkis who blew audiences away with that voice and self manipulation. Smeagol opens proceedings here as his friend discovers the one ring at the bottom of the lake. Up to this stage we are fully aware of the ring's pull over Gollum, but there is a delightful shock in store when the real Andy Serkis sets his eyes upon it in his friend's hand. A wonderfully cut montage sees Gollum up the present and his still changing debate over how his master affects him.Like the previous two films, there are multiple stories with the fellowship in the battle for Middle Earth, Frodo and Sam on their quest whilst there are numerous activities in the different parts of the country. The multiple concepts and issues flying around are smartly condensed into manageable moments of brilliance. Jackson has easily made the best of the three here, and rightfully and finally clinched his Oscar.

                The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King tops the first two films that came before it (The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers) - which is no easy feat considering the first two were near perfect films in their own right! Director Peter Jackson really has a passion and understanding for film-making and the beloved The Lord of the Rings books by J.R.R. Tolkien. Considering this film is the longest of the three, it would have been easy for any other filmmaker to make this film long and boring - only Peter Jackson could have successfully continually make it exciting (with only the very end of the film dragging on just a little bit). Again, an special mention goes to the cast (kudos to Sean Astin as Sam) and composer Howard Shore (whose theme for Gondor is one of the most majestic themes ever composed). A PERFECT 10 out of 10 (the first 10 out of 10 movie on the IMDb that I reviewed BTW!).

                Yes, it tests your bottom. Yes, it gets sentimental, boring, and weird, but how could you not enjoy this movie? (If you follow the movie law of averages, 60 bad minutes out of a 200-minute movie still equals a really good 140-minute movie). Truthfully, when I watch the DVD, I do skip through all those parts with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum (except in the tower of Cirith Ungol-- ""Not if I stick you first!""). However, it was really stunning and it had an almost inspiring ethereal mist about it. Also, if you watch it on DVD for the first time, the extended version is definitely what you should start off on if you plan to go back and watch the original theatrical as well (they cut a few minor, but good, things out). To the point, this movie is certainly something Tolkien would have had positive things to say about. And isn't that why filmmakers turn books into movies in the first place?

                Man, and you thought Titanic was cheesy?! When I first saw this film on the big screen, the multiple endings bothered me only a little. Now that I saw it for the second time, they simply outraged me. Best adapted screenplay, best director and best picture of the year all went this way. This time: not deserved. The Return of the King ends five times. FIVE TIMES!! I don't give a good goddamn if it was that way in the books too. I never read them. And that gives me a good position to rate this as a film and not a screen adaptation.Every single time Elijah Wood laughs in this movie (in the entire trilogy actually), I almost throw up. Couldn't they make it any more cheesier?! Especially stomach turning is the scene at the end of the RotK, where they all laugh and hug by Frodo's bed. OF COURSE in slow motion to add a little more sappiness. Plus the scene where their journey has ended and they all sit in the pub and skål their pints together.. check out the expression on Wood's face. So cheesy I laughed my a** off.The most worrying thing about all of this is that without the cheesiness and the multiple endings, this would've really been a great movie. I don't love them, but I do like these films. And it was such a tasteless display of drama from the academy to pretty much dismiss the two previous movies and award the last and most tasteless one in spades. It made the whole thing feel like the ""Russell Crowe-syndrome"", as I like to call it. They didn't award him the statue for The Insider, but instead for Gladiator the next year, because they probably felt so guilty. Maximus after all was clearly a more easier role than Wigand and didn't deserve the award as much.I can see why so many love this film and embrace it, but people, eleven Oscars? No.** / *****

                The third and final part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this is an entry that is once again visually impressive to the point of perfection, but also once again with little substance. Nevertheless, the film is to able better its predecessors in two key areas. It is less monotonous than the first two, and the characterisation is better than in the first two. However, by now better character development is of no use; the story has developed much too far without effectively involving the viewer. It is almost like a pretentious effort to suck in the viewers in the final part who were warded away earlier on by poor character development. Another point worthy of noting is that it is not overlong this time  that would be an understatement. It is severely overlong. The producers just do not know how to end a film. There are so many points when you think you have reached the closure that the whole last half hour is completely anticlimactic. To look at the films in perspective, they are all of about the same in quality, which is no surprise: they are just different cuts of one long film. All are above average films, as they have interesting technical elements. But they are not successes, because the writing is not up to the standard of the other aspects of the film. Adapting to the screen Tolkein's story was a massive task, and it did require a lot of effort, but what one looks for when assessing a film is was it successful? Film critique for me is about rewarding success  not how much effort one puts in. It is impossible to deny how much effort the whole cast and crew went to in order to produce this spectacular looking film, but they only ever half-succeeded in capturing the magic of Tolkein's tales.

                Don't worry...this won't contain any spoilers.  I just returned from attending a showing of the movie in Palm Springs, including a witty talk by Sir Ian McKellan.  I am ""one of those"" fans of Tolkien, who has read the books numerous times.  I was truly disappointed with what Peter Jackson did to Faramir in ""The Two Towers,"" but also realize there is a difference between film and novel in time to develop characters.  Additionally, Jackson felt a need to make the relationship between Aragorn and Arwen stronger, to attract more viewers.In ""The Return of the King,"" he stays pretty true to the book.  Though I personally disagree with creating a new storyline when time is of the essence (don't add, instead subtract, or combine characters and traits), regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed the third in the series.  I might follow this up in a few weeks, with more to the point comments, but as the release date isn't for almost two weeks, it would be unfair to comment more than I have.For those who have never read the books, you will love it.  For those who read the books long ago and don't remember details, you also will love it. For those who are huge fans of the books and remember every detail, parts will annoy you.  Yet, my guess is most of you will still remember that Jackson has done a fine job in depicting the works of Tolkien, with great special effects and characterization of a majority of the ensemble cast. Some of you won't get past those changes, but most of you will love it even with the somewhat flawed changes.

                It's REALLY good. Every single thing about this movie is cool. It's my number one favourite movie of all time. ( Well actually, the entire TRILOGY together is my favourite number one movie of all time. ) There's no swearing or nudity. I still don't recommend it for the younger audience because there are some slightly frightening scenes, though. But anybody over eleven shouldn't be bothered. I don't recommend it for arachnophobia, because it might give them a heart attack. Anyways, this movie has an excellent beginning and a wonderful ending. And everything in the middle is great, too. BY ALL MEANS RENT IT, but make sure you watch the two first movies first.

                Nothing is perfect if you think about it. Whatever you grasp at, you will always find a flaw. I'm not going to exaggerate, so I will say that ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" (2003) is no exception. But consider this. This is a movie that is the third film in a series. The direction is brilliant, the script adapted to near perfection. The characters from the book are portrayed by the actors magnificently on the big screen. They are chosen down to the smallest detail. Those that Peter Jackson /the director/ thought should have been changed a little, have been changed for the better. The music is........ GREAT!!!People, enough. The movie is almost 4 hours and it doesn't feel like it.Please tell me, give me an example of a movie that meets the above criteria and I'll buy you something.No questions asked: 10/10.

                While not strictly related to the books, I must mention that earlier this year when I went to England one of my destinations was Oxford. While I Oxford I went and had a beer at Tolkien's pub, visited Tolkien's house (20 Northmoor Avenue, there is a plaque on the house that identifies it as his house) and paid a visit to his gravestone. Tolkien was a professor of English literature at Oxford and it shows in his writings. As mentioned previously, he borrowed as lot of ideas from the many books that he had read and incorporated it seamlessly into his epic.It is said that Tolkien hated Shakespeare and considered his writings unoriginal and contrived. One thing he points at is Macbeth where Macbeth is told that he cannot be killed by one of woman born. This meant that it was only McDuff, who was born by cesarean, that could kill him. This, Tolkien though, was rubbish, and wrote into The Lord of the Rings a concept that he thought was much better, that is that the Witchking of Agmar could not be killed by any man, and it was Eowyn, the daughter of Theodren, that ends up slaying him. Personally, I think this is just as contrived, but Tolkien's dispute with Shakespeare can be left for another day.As with the opening of the Two Towers we are introduced to Theodren, a king driven mad by the power of Saruman, in Return of the King we are introduced to another mad ruler, the Steward of Gondor. Gondor does not have a king, and has not had a king for a very long time. Instead the land is ruled by the Stewards, but there is an anticipation that a king will return and take the throne, and this is something that the Steward does not want happening. He has become corrupted by power, and the only way that he is able to let go is through death.In Lord of the Rings, power corrupts, and corruption leads to madness. We see this clearly with Gollum. He finds the ring and in finding the ring is immediately entrapped by its power. Bilbo has pity on Gollum, and in the end so do we. His life is corrupted by one desire and that is to possess 'his precious' the one ring. The ring dominates his entire life, and he ends up hiding in a dark cave staring at his precious. However when he loses it his life is destroyed. It is at this point that even we, the reader, pity him, because we know that his life has no meaning beyond possession of the ring. This drives him to then search for the ring, and this greed that has corrupted his heart pretty much makes him untrustworthy. The only reason he helps Frodo is to attempt to get back his precious.There is a point where Gollum appears to have beaten his demon, and truly understands Frodo as a friend, but this changes when Frodo is forced to betray Gollum, but what Gollum does not realise, and never realises, is that Frodo did this to save his life. However Gollum is an individual that is driven by one obsession and it is this obsession that drives him to separate Sam from Frodo. He knows that the only thing standing between him and his precious is Sam, and he does what he can to get rid of Sam. However, as mentioned previously, it is Sam's undying loyalty to Frodo that drives him, and even when Frodo sends him away, Sam always remains there, ready to step up and save his friend.

                ""The Return of the King"" is certainly not the strongest of Tolkien's trilogy, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" blows both of the others away, but it is, in the novels, a considerable step up from the slop of ""The Two Towers."" This film series is different--""The Return of the King"" is the worst.There are two gigantic, absolutely unforgivable and completely and utterly wrong changes made from the novel that absolutely kill this film: 1. Frodo's madness ends when Golem takes the ring and then Golem falls into the fire, but the film forces Frodo to continue his madness and push Golem in. WRONG. 2. Samwise would NEVER leave Frodo, but the film has him head back down the mountain. WRONG. Not only are they differences from Tolkien, but these are changes that work against the story in which they fit and that is why they are so egregious.The production is mostly the same as the previous two in other aspects, with the exceptions that Ian McKellen's performance of Gandalf the White is annoying and nowhere near as good as Gandalf the Grey and that as he is given more to do, Sean Astin completely outshines the rest of the cast. It's also notable that this film has no appearances by Saruman, which cuts out the wonderful, charismatic performance that Christopher Lee has otherwise given--he was, in my opinion, the best casting choice of the entire series, with the only possible exception of Viggo Mortensen's perfect Aragorn.It's still a fantastic film, because Tolkien on a less-than-perfect day wrote a novel far beyond what most writers will even dream of being capable of writing, but this production's changes are absolutely unforgivable. The worst of the series, contrary to what the Oscars said.And how in the world can Howard Shore deserve two Oscars for one score that really wasn't all that impressive to begin with? And how can Peter Weir be denied AGAIN?

                In 2022 my plan was to review both the ""Lord of the Ring"" trilogy of Peter Jackson (2001 - 2003) and the two ""Nibelungen"" movies of Fritz Lang (1924), the reason being that both are ultimately based on the German ""Song of the Nibelungs"" and / or the Scandinavian ""Völsunga saga"". The ""Lord of the Ring"" novel by Tolkien (Jackson) and the Nibelungen opera-cycle by Wagner (Lang) functioned to a greater or lesser extent as an intermediate station with respect to these adaptations.As if they had heard about my plan, right at the start of 2022 Dutch television broadcasted al three episodes of the ""Lord of the Ring"". You can only admire the courage of Peter Jackson, because he was taking an enormous risk. How to involve all those that had not read the book in this labyrinthine story without rousing the indignation of those that had read the book (and often loved it) about leaving out too much detail?Jackson proved to be up to the task in a marvelous manner and brought the fantasy genre to the next level. Twenty years ago the computer generated images (cgi) used by Jackson were nothing less than revolutionary.In his review Roger Ebert remarked that in comparison with the novel the ""sword and sorcery"" element in the movie was emphasized too much. It was too much of ""The adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938, Michael Curtiz & William Keighley) and too little of ""The Wizard of Oz"" (1939, Victor Fleming). To translate this remark to the actual characters of the story. In the novel the Hobbits are realy the central characters while in the movie they are the weak spot of the group that have to be defended (in flashy action sequences of course) by the other members of the fellowship.There is a grain of truth in this comment. On the other hand, if you invest heavily in cgi and takes the fantasy genre to the next lever (as stated earlier in this review) you want some action in return, don't you?I called the story labyrinthine and indeed there are many species and races involved. The essence of the story is however rather clear.It is a story about the struggle between good and evil.The forces of the good (Hobbits, Elves, Dwars, Men) cooperate in a fellowship and are learning to appreciate each other more and more as the story unfolds.The evil as represented by the ring (lust for power) is not limited to certain characters. Anyone can in principle be infected by it. In effect there are characters that are evil in the trilogy, but had been good in earlier era's of the Tolkien story (not covered by the Jackson trilogy).""The return of the King"" is the last episode of the Ring trilogy. It is amazing that after the first two episodes Jackson is still capable of surprising his spectators. The battle at Pelennor fields in ""The return of the King"" surpasses the battle at Helm's deep in ""The two towers"", which was already taking your breath away.In the general remarks about the trilogy as a whole I defended the balance that Jackson has kept between action scenes and the Tolkien story. This does however not apply to the bombastic speeches preceding the action scenes, that irritated me more and more.Also in the general remarks I praised the computer generated images (CGI) that were state of the art at the time of release. In the scene in ""The return of the King"" in which Gandalf enters the city of Minas Tirith for the first time it striked me how well these cgi were integrated in and synchronised with the life action.While Frodo was the lead character in the first episode and Aragorn in the second, in the final episode the two lead characters were well matched. An improvement! On the other hand the character of Smeagol / Gollem is less interesting in ""The return of the King"" because his good (Smeagol) side is nearly non existent and he becomes the rather unidimensional bad Gollem.In ""The fellowship of the Ring"" Aragorn has a romance with the elf Arwen. In ""The two towers"" Eowyn, a noblewoman of Rohan, feels attracted to Aragorn. Because you expect that the battle against the evil Sauron ultimately will be won by the good forces, the big question becomes which of these two romances shall eventually come to fruition? Jackson answers this question, but in my opinion quite in a rushed way. Especially the story of Eowyn is rushed, but maybe this is less so in the extended edition of the film.Talking about Eowyn, in a MacBeth like scene she kills the Witch King of Angman, who imagined himself save on the battle field because he could not be killed by a man (just like MacBeth feels safe because no man born of woman can kill him).One of my favourite scenes towards the end is the scene in wich the Hobbits are back in the Shire, having a pint in a pub. This is the kind of life they have been fighting for, but after all they have gone through they are no longer capable of enjoying it. This realy is a scene in the spirit of Tolkien, who fought in the First World War and was of the opinion that in a war there is no winner and only losers.

                All of peter Jackson's film adaptation's of Jrr Tolkien's tell a tale of hope counter balanced with greed. And as the series concludes with Lord of the rings the return of the king the hope pays of for the heroes as Frodo and Sam finally destroy the ring despite the attempts to kill and tempt them. Many characters go through deep spiritual changes and somehow Jackson puts all these tales together without rushing the movie along. Among other things the movie is also a tale of good vs evil and as with most good vs evil movies the good win. Despite a few minor flaws such as focusing on the glory of war and not the horror. (If the movie was about a historical battle it would probably be a tragic tale and not a heroic tale.)But all in all the masterful tale cancels out the few flaws.

"132"," The problem with imagination

                Overall, I am disappointed, though not surprised, by the negative criticism of this movie. Indeed, this criticism exceeds the offering of alternative viewpoints and the expression of other cinematic possibilities and sinks into the realm of bitter invective. So many armchair critics are currently competing with avid Tolkien, Jackson, and movie fans alike in order to espouse the ""true"" value of Peter Jackson's landmark movie trilogy. For it is a landmark event in cinema history based on its sheer size and careful attention, praise and evisceration apart. The issue that greatly irritates me and pushes me to write is that many of the negative reviewers on this website have such limited room in their imagination that they cannot conceive of a world outside their own narrow framework. I find that a most sad reality in light of the legacy of Tolkien, Jackson, and all good story-tellers -- to create, to engender, and to nourish the growth of any and all imaginative ventures.The problem with imagination is that it is an individual event, a unique subjective experience that a single person experiences completely alone. Those who enter into the realm of Art, Fiction, Fantasy, and any degree of Story-telling agree (willingly or no) to take that personal act of creation and primal nature and share it with the community of human beings, each of whom has his or her own imaginative context. It is a bold act of sacrifice, self-confidence, and faith (spiritual, one could argue) to thrust the contents of one's subjective reality into (to borrow from Douglas Adams) the Whole Sort of General Mish Mash. People who do so deserve respect for the mere creative act, the ability to foist forward what they believe is true. From Homer to Bill O'Reilly, this concept of personal creation, what Tolkien called Sub-Creation, is the essence of modern human existence, and we owe it to each other to respect the right to creation history has granted us.Therefore, in defense of both Tolkien (whom some on this website have maligned) and Jackson (whom many have maligned), I forward that both are imaginative creators in their own right, with different and completely acceptable offerings to the world. Those who cannot tolerate either for ""mediocre writing"" or ""atrocious film-making"" should offer forth their literary or cinematic offspring instead of cunningly-worded diatribes of their deep dissatisfaction with all that does not conform to their inner reality. Then, we few who believe in and trust the creative ability of all will be able to see how those critical inner realities (so authoritative in exposition) match up with the rest of our perceptions.Tolkien was an enormously talented, intelligent, and imaginative man, one whose stories, though unpolished by experience, still managed to attract a worldwide audience and devoted following with their luster. Jackson's movies took the sheen and inherent value of Tolkien's stories and placed it in a visual medium, a place where fans of LOTR could witness and love the events and people they held so dear. Of course Tolkien's story is imperfect; of course Jackson's movies aren't as full as we wish them to be. Their great successes are that they still manage to capture our imagination, to move us, to take genuine truth and isolate it in a world outside our ken, a place where we see ourselves better against a foreign backdrop. Both have created and done so masterfully, with the intuitive grasp that is termed ""genius."" Tolkien would have had much at issue with Jackson's movies, where plot incongruities, lapsed character development, and visual splendor overshadow the philological and melancholic overtones of his book. Jackson admits he finds much at issue with Tolkien's book, including a lack of clear character motivation, extended and largely extraneous dialog, and heightened language not suited for Hollywood. But Tolkien, despite his perfectionist griping and loathing for any film version of his book, would respect Jackson for continuing the act of creation, for taking his modern-day mythology and spreading it to as many people as possible. Jackson has taken the beauty, the scope, the complexity, the richness, and the loss that permeate Middle-Earth and shared those leitmotifs with the world. Tolkien's characteristic ""niggling"" would have prevented any such attempt (even Jackson's), but in the end, his heritage lives on in beautifully conceived and executed films.I do not ask others to stifle their opinions of this movie or any other. Indeed, continue to express the direst and bleakest of your frustrations with the creative power of others, as it may lead you to actually do some creation yourself. Remember though, that the great evils of history, from Satan to Hitler to Sauron, are never capable of creation -- only twisting, mutilating, mocking, deforming, and misapplying. Be open to the vision of others and what they have to offer, especially when that offering comes in the virtuosic shape of Tolkien's writing or Jackon's movies. Look for the True in the Secondary and how it manifests itself everywhere once you recognize it.This movie receives a 10 from me because it not only maintains incredible faithfulness to Tolkien's themes (and yes, events may deviate in completely separate and dissimilar media) but it asks intelligent viewers to look deeper into the circumstances of its own creation and beauty. From the loyalty of Sam and the weight of epic history to the sacrifice of Arwen and the never-completely-won nature of war, Jackson's movies capture the essence and heart of Tolkien's tale, with the benefit of the director's own imaginative fruit as well. The world owes Mr. Jackson its gratitude, as he has created another world and another reality that so many can, do, and will cherish.One final word: There are few who would not rather be wandering in a far green country rather than dwelling in their own Circles of the World.

                Before I started college, I watched a bunch of DVDs, including all the original versions of Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. I liked part 1: ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" and part 2: ""The Two Towers"" was not the best of the trilogy, but at least everything was set up for this movie - the final chapter in the trilogy! Back when I saw this for the first time on DVD, this was the third best movie ever made (now this is the 4th best movie ever made with ""The Godfather: Part II"" taking that spot, another movie I plan on watching in the future) and this is the best action movie ever made according to this website. I definitely agree - all the action sequences are breathless! However, the very last 20 minutes of this film were too slow for me - but at least that meant that all good things must come to an end, huh? It also shows that the three parts had a connection which flowed very nicely: starting at the bottom, then going up to the climax, and then going back down again.Before you watch this movie, I must warn you that this movie is 3 hours and 20 minutes long! Here's my plan: watch a part a day; this will make watching ""Lord of the Rings"" more exciting! And be sure that you're watching the original movies first. If you like DVDs and watching action films, then these movies are right for you.

                'The Lord of The Rings' by J. R. R Tolkien is probably the most eloquent, elaborate and seminal piece of fiction ever written. The Saga is 6 Books long, a rich narrative with Maps, Poems and Ballads, which is brought to life by the auteur Peter Jackson in his Lord of The Rings Trilogy.The Lord of The Rings is the fable of Frodo Baggings and his misadventures leading finally to the destruction of the One Ring of Power. It is a tale of Friendship, Loyalty, Betrayal, Politics, War, and much more - An Epic of our Time.Peter Jackson through his Trilogy pays homage to Tolkien. Jackson is the Pupil and Tolkein is the Master, and the Trilogy is Jackson's reverence to Tolkien. He through his artistic genius gives colour to this fictitious world of Dwarves, Elves, Men, Hobbits, Orcs, Nazgûl's and The Dark Lord. He gives face to its various people, and brings to screen their tribulations, their emotions, their misgivings, their endeavours and its outcomes.The Trilogy is divided into 3 Parts - 'The Fellowship of The Ring', 'The Two Towers' and 'The Return of The King'. The films portray the adventures of the hobbit Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) of the Shire and the Fellowship which was convened in the Council of Elrond under Lord Elrond (Hugo Weaving) in Rivendell. The Fellowship consisted of the Hobbits Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), Samwise Gamgee (Sean Astin), Peregrin Took (Billy Boyd) and Meriadoc Brandybuck (Dominic Monaghan), the Elf Legolas (Orlando Bloom), the Dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), the Wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), and of the race of Men Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) and Boromir (Sean Bean). These 9 compromised the Fellowship who embarked from Rivendell on a quest to destroy The One Ring in the Fires of Mount Doom where it was yielded by Sauron 'The Dark Lord' (Alan Howard), the only place where it can be undone. The destruction of The One Ring ensures the destruction of Sauron. The Fellowship eventually splits up and Frodo continues the quest with his loyal companion and friend Sam and the treacherous Gollum (Andy Serkis). Meanwhile, Aragorn, heir in exile to the throne of Gondor, along with Legolas, Gimli, Boromir, Merry, Pippin and the wizard Gandalf, unite to save the Free People of Middle-earth from the forces of Sauron and rally them in the War of the Ring to aid Frodo by distracting Sauron's attention. The saga ends with the destruction of The Ring along with The Dark Lord, Aragorn being anointed King of Gondor and the Hobbits retiring back to the Shire. In the Shire, Frodo completes the account of his and Bilbo's (Ian Holm) Adventures and undertakes the journey to the Undying Lands on an Elven Ship leaving Middle Earth along with Lord Elrond, Gandalf and an old and senile Bilbo.Each film of Peter Jackson's Trilogy is approximately 3 hours long (The Director's Cut being 4 Hours). Despite being protracted, Peter Jackson manages to keep the viewer enthralled and on the edge of his seat during the whole viewing. Despite this, Jackson couldn't cover the whole range of Tolkien's work. On reading Tolkien's books, one realises, a myriad of events have not been depicted in the films. To give an example, The Wild Men of The Woods 'Drúedain' haven't been portrayed in the films nor have they received mention. The Chief of the Drúedain guided King Theoden's Army of Rohirrim through the Secret Pass of Stonewain Valley to avoid being attacked by the Orcs so that they could safely reach Minas Tirith for aid. This event is described by Tolkien in the Chapter 'Ride of The Rohirrim' in book 5. In another example, the Hobbits journey through the Old Forest and how they were assisted by Tom Bombadil. This too has been skipped in the films.Jackson has taken certain Creative Liberties while creating these films (Most probably, I reckon for emphatic effect). Jackson at certain instances has strayed from Tolkien's work and imposed his own ideas into the narrative. For example, in the films, it is Arwen (Liv Tyler) who rescues Frodo from the Nazgûl's after he was stabbed on the Tower of Amon Sul and brings him to Rivendell where he is healed by the Elves. However, in Tolkien's narrative, it is the elf Glorfindel who assists Frodo reach Rivendell in time. Another such instance is in regards to 'Narsil' - The Sword That Was Broken. According to Jackson's Films, the Shards of Narsil were kept safe in Rivendell until they were reforged into Andúril, and was brought to Aragorn by Lord Elrond himself. In Tolkien's work, the shards of Narsil are passed down as heirloom by the heirs of Isildur, the last owner being Aragorn. Before the Fellowship departs from Rivendell, Narsil is reforged into Andúril and is carried by Aragorn.If he were alive I do not know how Tolkien would react to these changes in the narrative. However, despite these creative liberties by Jackson, his Trilogy is, till date, the best adaption of Tolkien's work.The impeccable Casting of characters is what makes the Trilogy live up to the hype. Ian MacKellen and Andy Serkis have to be specially mentioned for their portrayal of Gandalf and Gollum respectively. Jackson has even managed to include poems and ballads from Tolkien's narrative into the films in the form of Songs. These songs are backed up by a brilliant Music Composition which is surreal and mystifying. Apart from these, it's the Visual Effects which make the film truly stand out.The Trilogy truly does justice to Tolkien's genius. It is nothing short of a Masterpiece. The 11 Academy Award wins by the Third Film of the Trilogy -'Return of The King', proves the same. With these 11 wins, it ties with Ben-Hur and Titanic for the most awarded Film in Academy History, a feat in it's own. Today, nearly 2 decades after the release of the last instalment, the Trilogy has attained a Cult status among fans and its popularity keeps on waxing. The Trilogy just might prove to be one of the few works of art that stand the test of time.A Review by -

                Frodo, Sam and Gollum continue their quest for Mordor to destroy the one ring while the Battle for Middle Earth rages on.The final part of Peter Jackson's epic trilogy was at the time, the highest grossing film ever to grace our screens and up until this film, fan hype and speculation was rightfully anticipating how the magician Jackson would conclude the wonderfully courageous adaptation of J.R.R Tolkien's novel.The previous release, The Two Towers, was showcased by an eccentric display by the director, orchestrating a once more beautifully cinematic approach to scenery and balancing it with a blend of tight and exciting war and fantasy concepts. He proved The Fellowship was no fluke and maintaining his flow in the sequel, the New Zealander was able to carry forth this momentum into the final part with the same vigour and energy as his previous two smashes. There are certainly cases here for the best shots of the entire trilogy. When Frodo is walking slowly and there is a huge spider looming makes great tension but, on a personal level, the best part of the entire series comes near to the end when Frodo and Sam are so very close to banishing the ring for good, and with one simple close shot, Jackson captures Frodo's feelings of desire and madness, which makes for a heart stopping and riveting twist.Peter Jackson has certainly taken the magic of the novels and twisted and shot them into fan's favourites. The complexity of the battle sequences, the close eye upon constant political and action ideologies and weaving a tight knot around such a huge crew is a fantastic achievement and is only bettered by the fact he has made the legendary books into films for anyone of any age, for anytime of the year and for any situation. There is humour, romance, action, war, drama and significantly a wonderful sense of escapism with the fantasy genre, astounding stuff to recapture the critically acclaimed mind of J.R.R Tolkien's work.One huge input into the success which still has fans in awe is the CGI Andy Serkis who blew audiences away with that voice and self manipulation. Smeagol opens proceedings here as his friend discovers the one ring at the bottom of the lake. Up to this stage we are fully aware of the ring's pull over Gollum, but there is a delightful shock in store when the real Andy Serkis sets his eyes upon it in his friend's hand. A wonderfully cut montage sees Gollum up the present and his still changing debate over how his master affects him.Like the previous two films, there are multiple stories with the fellowship in the battle for Middle Earth, Frodo and Sam on their quest whilst there are numerous activities in the different parts of the country. The multiple concepts and issues flying around are smartly condensed into manageable moments of brilliance. Jackson has easily made the best of the three here, and rightfully and finally clinched his Oscar.

                The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King tops the first two films that came before it (The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers) - which is no easy feat considering the first two were near perfect films in their own right! Director Peter Jackson really has a passion and understanding for film-making and the beloved The Lord of the Rings books by J.R.R. Tolkien. Considering this film is the longest of the three, it would have been easy for any other filmmaker to make this film long and boring - only Peter Jackson could have successfully continually make it exciting (with only the very end of the film dragging on just a little bit). Again, an special mention goes to the cast (kudos to Sean Astin as Sam) and composer Howard Shore (whose theme for Gondor is one of the most majestic themes ever composed). A PERFECT 10 out of 10 (the first 10 out of 10 movie on the IMDb that I reviewed BTW!).

                Yes, it tests your bottom. Yes, it gets sentimental, boring, and weird, but how could you not enjoy this movie? (If you follow the movie law of averages, 60 bad minutes out of a 200-minute movie still equals a really good 140-minute movie). Truthfully, when I watch the DVD, I do skip through all those parts with Frodo, Sam, and Gollum (except in the tower of Cirith Ungol-- ""Not if I stick you first!""). However, it was really stunning and it had an almost inspiring ethereal mist about it. Also, if you watch it on DVD for the first time, the extended version is definitely what you should start off on if you plan to go back and watch the original theatrical as well (they cut a few minor, but good, things out). To the point, this movie is certainly something Tolkien would have had positive things to say about. And isn't that why filmmakers turn books into movies in the first place?

                Man, and you thought Titanic was cheesy?! When I first saw this film on the big screen, the multiple endings bothered me only a little. Now that I saw it for the second time, they simply outraged me. Best adapted screenplay, best director and best picture of the year all went this way. This time: not deserved. The Return of the King ends five times. FIVE TIMES!! I don't give a good goddamn if it was that way in the books too. I never read them. And that gives me a good position to rate this as a film and not a screen adaptation.Every single time Elijah Wood laughs in this movie (in the entire trilogy actually), I almost throw up. Couldn't they make it any more cheesier?! Especially stomach turning is the scene at the end of the RotK, where they all laugh and hug by Frodo's bed. OF COURSE in slow motion to add a little more sappiness. Plus the scene where their journey has ended and they all sit in the pub and skål their pints together.. check out the expression on Wood's face. So cheesy I laughed my a** off.The most worrying thing about all of this is that without the cheesiness and the multiple endings, this would've really been a great movie. I don't love them, but I do like these films. And it was such a tasteless display of drama from the academy to pretty much dismiss the two previous movies and award the last and most tasteless one in spades. It made the whole thing feel like the ""Russell Crowe-syndrome"", as I like to call it. They didn't award him the statue for The Insider, but instead for Gladiator the next year, because they probably felt so guilty. Maximus after all was clearly a more easier role than Wigand and didn't deserve the award as much.I can see why so many love this film and embrace it, but people, eleven Oscars? No.** / *****

                The third and final part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, this is an entry that is once again visually impressive to the point of perfection, but also once again with little substance. Nevertheless, the film is to able better its predecessors in two key areas. It is less monotonous than the first two, and the characterisation is better than in the first two. However, by now better character development is of no use; the story has developed much too far without effectively involving the viewer. It is almost like a pretentious effort to suck in the viewers in the final part who were warded away earlier on by poor character development. Another point worthy of noting is that it is not overlong this time  that would be an understatement. It is severely overlong. The producers just do not know how to end a film. There are so many points when you think you have reached the closure that the whole last half hour is completely anticlimactic. To look at the films in perspective, they are all of about the same in quality, which is no surprise: they are just different cuts of one long film. All are above average films, as they have interesting technical elements. But they are not successes, because the writing is not up to the standard of the other aspects of the film. Adapting to the screen Tolkein's story was a massive task, and it did require a lot of effort, but what one looks for when assessing a film is was it successful? Film critique for me is about rewarding success  not how much effort one puts in. It is impossible to deny how much effort the whole cast and crew went to in order to produce this spectacular looking film, but they only ever half-succeeded in capturing the magic of Tolkein's tales.

                Don't worry...this won't contain any spoilers.  I just returned from attending a showing of the movie in Palm Springs, including a witty talk by Sir Ian McKellan.  I am ""one of those"" fans of Tolkien, who has read the books numerous times.  I was truly disappointed with what Peter Jackson did to Faramir in ""The Two Towers,"" but also realize there is a difference between film and novel in time to develop characters.  Additionally, Jackson felt a need to make the relationship between Aragorn and Arwen stronger, to attract more viewers.In ""The Return of the King,"" he stays pretty true to the book.  Though I personally disagree with creating a new storyline when time is of the essence (don't add, instead subtract, or combine characters and traits), regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed the third in the series.  I might follow this up in a few weeks, with more to the point comments, but as the release date isn't for almost two weeks, it would be unfair to comment more than I have.For those who have never read the books, you will love it.  For those who read the books long ago and don't remember details, you also will love it. For those who are huge fans of the books and remember every detail, parts will annoy you.  Yet, my guess is most of you will still remember that Jackson has done a fine job in depicting the works of Tolkien, with great special effects and characterization of a majority of the ensemble cast. Some of you won't get past those changes, but most of you will love it even with the somewhat flawed changes.

                I remember watching this movie for the first time when I was 12 years old. It was New Year's Eve. I sat next to my PC, brought a whole bottle of white wine for some reason and watched the whole trilogy until the morning. Needless to say I also got drunk for the first time. Best experience ever :D.

                I read LOTR for the first time about 25 years ago, at a time when you had to look for the book in the darkest corner of your local bookstore. It was a time when reading SF or Fantasy resulted in funny looks from your pals, and raised eyebrows from your teachers.Now Peter Jackson turned this book into a mass phenomenon, and it is suddenly very trendy to out yourself as a LOTR fan. I have watched the directors cut of the first two parts at least ten times on DVD. Both extended versions are very good, and I do not know which one to prefer. My expectations for the third part were of course very high. After all, Peter Jackson liked it best, so it should be the best part of the trilogy.However, I do not think it is better than the first two parts. It is certainly a very good movie, but there are parts, which I did not like. This review contains spoilers, is more a nit picker's comment, and may also not be very helpful for people without a certain background knowledge of the books of Tolkien.1. Intro: Each of the three parts starts with an intro. In the first we see and here the background story on the war against Sauron with Gil Galad and Elendil. Brilliant. In the second, we see Gandalfs fight with the Balrog to a wonderful soundtrack. Brilliant. And in the third? Smeagols transformation into Gollum, mainly pretty disgusting...and not necessary for the understanding of the plot (we heard all about that already in the second part). Also, I found the acting not convincing. All together a week start, and not in the same league as the first parts.2. Isengard scene: Where was Saruman? What was that scene for? Just for Pippin to find the Palanthir in the muck? I surely hope that we get to see more on the DVD.3. To much of weary, dirty hobbits in the mud. The pacing is pretty slow, Gollum's schizophrenia was well established in part II. Not necessary for the plot and the movie.4. Arwen: My most loathed character of all three movies. Named third in the credits for a few unnecessary scenes. She acts like a young American girl (what she is) and not like a three thousand year old grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-aunt of Aragorn. What a difference in the few scenes we see with Galadriel!5. Aragorn: The title is the Return of the king. However, Aragorn does not get much to play this role. In the book, he challenges Sauron in the Palanthir and announces his return, whilst in the movie, he can barely hold the thing, and gets unconscious looking at it. I look forward to the DVD to hear Jacksons explanation of this unnecessary change. Also the path of the death story line is not convincing. If you read this in the book, it has a different flavour to it. The Death never fought in Minas Tirith, but for the movie it may have been useful, since it allowed to clean Minas Tirith of Orcs within a few seconds (Orcs, who had no business being there in the first place!). The unforgivable omission in Aragorn's character is that they did not show him as a healer. The Hands of the King are the Hands of a Healer. This is one of the most important parts of the third book, because it establishes Aragorn's right to the throne of Gondor, and gives him almost God like powers. To leave that out whilst wasting so much time on other redundant parts is very sad.6. Battle scenes: I must admit that the attack of the Rohirim is one of the best scenes in all three movies. (and Theoden a much better king than Aragorn, it was the other way round in the Two Towers! So Aragorn did not develop whilst Theoden did). But there is too much fighting. Too many lovely details of Orc gimmicks. From a story tellers point of few, the siege of Minas Tirith (saved by the cavalry!) is a larger copy of the siege of Helm's deep (saved by...the cavalry). In the book, the focus is not so much on this battle. It is a small part of the Return of the King (albeit a highlight), but in the movie, the battle seems to never end, the Orcs conquer almost the entire city (they do not even enter in the book), and Gandalf has lost his superior, god like powers of the book (after all, he is a Maiar, a sort of lesser angel), except in his lonely charge to help the returning Faramir.7. Denethor: What a caricature of the figure in the book! The steward is portrayed as a Shakespearean Richard III type villain, who is totally mad. Nobody bothers to explain, that he is fighting with Sauron in his personal Palanthir (just to have the power to look into such a thing repeatedly and NOT betray his people is something in his favour...)8. The fight with the Witch king: Very good movie adaptation, but still one of Tolkien's inconclusive scenes. At Amon Sul in the first movie, Aragorn chases away the witch king and four other wraiths with a burning stick and a lesser sword (although the ONE Ring was within inches of their grasp!). On the Pellenor field, the same Witch King is almost as powerful as Sauron himself, and no man can kill or defeat him. Why and where has he gained so much power?9. In the trailer we see Theoden knighting Merry on the top of Edoras. Did I miss this in the movie?10. Shelop's Lair. All together a very good adaptation, three nit picking comments: Shelop smells strongly in the book, so it is unlikely she could sneak up on Frodo like in the movie. In the movie she stings him in the chest or back (clearly in the middle of his body). But there he should be protected by his Mithril chain mail! Also, Sam could not get the ring out without destroying the cocoon.11. Finally, why on Middle earth did they not use the eagles in the first place for this quest? I am sure Gwaihir, or what his name is, would be understanding enough to fly Frodo from Rivendell to Mordor, if this would save Middle Earth. But this is of course a question, I should have asked Tolkien 25 years ago...Bottom line: I will wait eagerly for the extended DVD. Hopefully (as before with Lorien in part I and Treebeard in part II), this will add the much needed depths to the movie.

                The Lord of the Rings Trilogy reminds me of something with which I am quite familiar as a long-time denizen of Central New York: a steaming pile of horse manure. You know, that sickly sweet smell, wafting across hills on a summer breeze. Some people find the scent pleasant. I disagree.Likewise with LOTR. It seems Peter Jackson confused everyone into thinking that this series was something epic, something gargantuan, something important. Really, though, it's not. Yes, it is epic and it's long too, but it's not an important cinematic event. In fifty years, I dare say it'll be forgotten along with Titanic. You remember that plate of tripe, don't you? No, by the time I'm lying prostrate on a hospital bed, these three movies will have long been expunged from my memory and the memories of most others.You see, Mr. Jackson somehow forgot to concoct an interesting story when he drafted his endless (and often excruciatingly dull) battle scenes. There is, really, no character development to speak of. Frodo and Sam remain one-dimensional throughout and what depth Jackson gives them is cursory. And the rest? I have a difficult time keeping them straight.I'm sorry, Ringies, this movie just isn't that good. Maybe it's the glossy coating. See, I love Star Wars and, to be fair, many of the criticisms I've leveled against LOTR could also be leveled against George Lucas' films. Oh, and when I say Star Wars, I speak of the original trilogy. Yet, for all it's craftsmanship, the original Star Wars films were sort of clunky. You could tell that they were models made by hand, sets made by hand, costumes made by hand. It looked like a B-movie and felt like a B-movie and it was a B-movie, albeit one with great set design, costumes, effects, etc. LOTR really is a B-movie as well. Or at least it would have been 50 years ago. Yet, in today's market, it gets gussied up, made into an A-picture and it doesn't deserve it. I'm sorry, I just don't find this movie all that good and you'll never convince me otherwise.5/10 - Three points for tree-beard or whatever his name is and two for the ambition to even film it.

                Though certainly an improvement upon the second film in this already classic trilogy, I must say I am shocked that of all the incredible films I could name right off the top of my head that could be sitting in the fifth position in IMDb's list of Top 250 Highest Rated Films, this is the one that's sitting there. I know I'm quite tardy in my viewing of this movie, and I've known of its sky-high praise for the four or five years it's been in release, and I thought that even though the subject matter, as I explained in my reviews of the preceding two Lord of the Rings films, is not my cup of tea, I would see what everyone else sees in these movies. I was very fond of the first one, I was grateful when I saw the ending credits of the second one, and though I found myself entertained more than the second one by the third one, I was even more grateful when the final credits arrived. I will start with what I liked: The battle sequences in this film were much better than the ones in its predecessor. I thought the second film's battles were lame and this time around, they had a lot of intensity, and I found myself drawn in. Where I found myself riveted was during the climax, the fate of the ring to be determined on a coarse cliff over molting lava, and everything unexpected happens and all of the present characters in the scene have tension that finally culminates and releases, and I finally truly found myself caring about the ring, even if it doesn't make sense that Shalob can stink Frodo through a supposedly impermeable vest.But now, let's get down to brass tacks about the denouement. I have never seen a movie that ends as many times as The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. After awhile, I was counting the ""final"" scenes. Counting! Then, I found myself shocked that I had given up on counting. Who counts endings to one movie? I cannot stand a badly paced film. I've always thought of directors like Peter Jackson as directors who are particularly good at keeping a brisk pace, no matter how long the movie is. But, not only do his endings lag in this single film, but they are plagued further by two horrible things: 1) Every time one ending closes, it fades out and the screen remains black for several seconds. Then it fades up again, having fooled you and the interest that causes you to stay with a film to the end has left. This happens every-single-time-the-movie-makes-you-think-it's-ending. 2) After awhile, this series of endings becomes intensely contrived and meaningless. We don't need to see most of the things that happen! And if Jackson still wants us to see what happens to these characters, as these things must in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, he should pace it better so that it does not feel stretched, tacked on, or contrived. Perfect way to achieve this: Get rid of the deceptive fade-outs!I enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring, and I suppose the last two films had their moments, but all I can say is that I am glad that I'm finished with this trilogy and that I don't have to worry about seeing them ever again.

                Not surprisingly, a lot of good plot had been removed from the story, and a lot of bad plot inserted. This is hardly news; the same happened to the two predecessors. Much was lost by skipping ""The Scouring of the Shire"". The computer graphics are well-done but rarely convincing, and Gollum's only task is to provide comic relief. Most of the audience seemed to find him quite funny. I was just bored.Tolkien's books told a great story basically about the weakness of men (and other races), and the importance of not fighting alone. The best example being the events on the edge of Mount Doom. Tolkien made a strong point in that nobody is perfect, neither perfectly good nor perfectly evil.The film completely ignores this and simplifies things to pure black and white. There's good, and there's evil, with nothing in-between , no shades of grey.And that I think is sad.All that being said, the film has a few but important qualities, and that's the great camera work, the excellent acting and the stunning scenery - CG-scenery too.The rest of the CG is not that interesting, except for Shelob the spider who really makes up for it. The sound of a whole cinema audience simultaneously gasping in horror as ... Well, I won't spoil for those who haven't read the books. But wow. So, in the end, despite all its flaws, I recommend seeing this film. But go see it now, on the big screen. It won't be worth your time on TV.

                The high rating of this movie baffles me. While it had superb special effects and above average acting, it failed miserably in telling the story. I was extremely disappointed. I adored the first film in the trilogy, understanding that you cannot include everything in a movie that is in a book. The second film was also excellent, although it began to try too hard to be important and profound. This last installment was intensely boring at times as it strived to be profound. This could have been a great movie, as it so often depicted scenes according to my imagination. Unfortunately, while describing the world it lost the essence of the story. The movie seemed to lose its way not only with pace, but with its heart. This marvelous story of extraordinary effort by the gifted and those less so to face head on an evil of incredible proportions went astray at too many crucial points. Granted it hit the mark in places, but it in others it almost seemed to take the credit from the valiant and place it solely on supernatural and circumstance.

                as you see in the title, you can see it was a great film. i have only had the DVD for 2 weeks and i got a 2 disc DVD for £2.99. wow you might think.well back to the film, and this is a film whose without its amazing and stunning fights/wars, would be a OK film but wouldn't be a classic. when the battles begin, you can't stop watching- even if your mum asks you to tidy up. the scenes with the horses and their warriors galloping is breath taking and makes you want to re enact it as i'm a 13 year old boy, this was a film which you want to re enact and talk about. it fills you with thrill which is a very special thing to do. when people saw this, people were like, ""wow what an amazing film!"" and ""it's so good, i want to see it again and again!"" i think this film was done by the right people and acted by the right people you couldn't image anyone for the roles. Such as aragon's character, Viggo Mortensen matchs that style and his emotions were amazing. his fighting style and knowledge makes him a great character and Viggo Mortensen should of good a dozen awards. before this film, i never heard of Viggo Mortensen and now after his role, i regard him as a brilliant actor.another character who was amazing was gandalf and without him, this film would feel empty. sir ian meleken (sorry for the spelling mistake), his acting was so believable and amazing. but his secret to this as revealed in a episode of extras, his that he thought of what it would be like to be a wizard and well, that give us the great gandalf we know today! i think this film is the best film i have seen in years and it deserved every award. out of ten, i would give this a MASSIVE TEN! thank you!

                I'm a huge fan of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, but strangely enough I don't mind too much that liberties have been taken with the original story to suit Peter Jackson's cinematic rendering: I understand and accept that changes are inevitable when adapting such an epic work for the big screen. What I cannot forgive, however, is giving Legolas' superpowers during the Battle of Pelennor Fields and cutting out one of my favourite parts the book—Saruman's fate (I know Christopher Lee feels the same way!).Watching a poorly rendered elf leaping around with impossible ease on a CGI 'oliphaunt' before killing all on board and sliding down the trunk (allowing Gimli to make another wisecrack) is going a step too far in my book, reminding me of the awful digital excesses that were to follow in Jackson's next film, King Kong (shudder); rounding off the film without showing us what happens to Lee's evil white wizard and his slimy pal Grima Wormtongue is an even worse decision, one that leaves fans of the book wondering whether they fell asleep before the end and missed an entire chunk (yeah, yeah, I know this bit is in the extended edition, but I'm talking about the version I paid to see at the cinema!).The Return of the King is still a very impressive effort, with stunning battle scenes, a genuinely creepy giant spider, an army of ghosts, and a thrilling climax that takes place inside an erupting volcano, and I'm grateful to all involved for realising what many considered to be totally un-filmable, but I really wanted the last chapter to be the best of the lot. And it isn't.Oh well, fingers crossed for The Hobbit...

                Frodo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee are guided by Gollum to the darkest of Mordor. Gandalf leads the group to to Isengard where they are surprised to find Merry and Pippin having already defeated Saruman. Pippin touches the crystal ball and Sauron mistakenly assumes that he is the ring bearer. Gandalf and Pippin travel to Gondor's capital Minas Tirith but they find mad Denethor on the throne.The quest comes to an end. There is a ton of CGI and it's state of the art. It is fully deserving of the moniker epic. It comes to a climatic apocalyptic battle at Minas Tirith. Then the movie has to keep going for another hour. That can't be helped but the battle in front of the Black Gate is no more than anti-climatic. Also Aragorn releasing the Dead Men struck me as short-sighted heroism. Sometimes, watching something can shine a different light on the idea. It would be better for the Dead Men to not give Aragorn a choice. This movie broke the Oscars by winning eleven. Technically it is far superior and the story is a compelling epic.

                Well, it's finally over:  Peter Jackson's adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's mediocre epic concludes with  *The Return of the King*, a 3-1/2-hour test of endurance.  How many times can a movie show Elijah Wood's big blue eyes welling up with tragic tears?  how many times do our heroes single-handedly dispatch thousands of evil creatures apiece during big battles?  how many times do we have to endure the jokes from that hairy dwarf?  how many times must Howard Shore's repetitive, sappy score rise to deafening levels whenever a minor character lies in a broken heap on the battlefield?  how many times must director Jackson waste his wide screen photography with gigantic close-ups of the actors  (I haven't seen so many BIG HEADS since the last Academy Awards broadcast)?  how many times must we withstand grand, cartoon-animated armies? . . . and how many more times must we watch plot developments that contain virtually no suspense??  (What -- did you think the Dark Lord would win?  that any of the main characters of the Fellowship would actually die?)Apparently, many MORE times, because this 3-1/2-hour trudge is but the appetizer to the main course of the  ""Extended Edition"", New Line's continuing money-grab that will reveal perhaps a FIVE-HOUR version of this movie alone.  (Taken all together, *The Lord of the Rings* -- The Extended Version -- approaches the length of 14 hours, give or take.)  Well, as P. T. Barnum once observed, There's a sucker born every minute, and New Line has found the suckers, who are not only willing to pay at the movie theater, but are also only too willing to fork out exorbitant amounts for  ""special editions""  of movies that ought to have stood on their own -- AS RELEASED. A simple standard should obtain in a movie theater:  what you're seeing on the screen should be what a director wants you to see.  ""Extended-edition DVD's""  don't count, and especially should not be taken in consideration in reviews by either professional critics or by amateur reviewers at places like IMDb.  I can already hear the defenders of the films demur, ""But these movies would've been too long if Jackson didn't cut them into shorter versions!""  But that's precisely my point.  *The Lord of the Rings* remains an unfilmable book:  it's too long; it's too unwieldy.  As far as an adaptation is concerned, none -- not less -- would be more.Which is not to say that there aren't any great filmic moments in *Return of the King*:  the lighting of the watch-fires along the mountain ranges is pure cinema; the entire scene with Frodo and Sam fending off a giant spider in a cobwebby cave is terrific, providing the one suspenseful stretch in the entire movie; and Gollum remains a wonderful creation, a rare successful collaboration of technology and old-fashioned creative virtues.  Taken as a whole, the movie is better than, say, *The Matrix*  or other expensive Hollywood blockbusters of the  ""action-adventure""  genre.  But to say so is not to say much.  The occasional high points don't constitute a comprehensive whole, or make Tolkien's saga any less silly.  It's a book about magic rings, wizards, Dark Lords, and dwarfs, for God's sake.  In *Return of the King*, there's a scene in Minas Tirith where the citizens watch a sad parade of soldiers go by:  but it's comical, because everyone looks like refugees from a Renaissance Faire.  It doesn't do to inflate this material to cosmic levels.  Claims that Tolkien's fantasy was the greatest book of the 20th Century truly make my head spin:  what, was  *Ulysses* chopped liver?  What was the second greatest book -- Stephen King's  *The Stand*?Pardon my long-windedness, but the very subject inspires it.  I'll wrap by lamenting that one of the better elements in the first two installments, Christopher Lee as Saruman, was a victim of the cutting room floor.  Even fans of this material might agree with me that any number of the scenes with Frodo and Sam blubbering at each other would've been better replaced with a coda to the Saruman plot-line.  While others may say, ""Well, he'll be in the Extended-Edition version,""  I'm sure that will be cold comfort to Mr. Lee. At least Saruman was a villain we could sink our teeth into:  in *Return*, we must instead settle for that damned Eyeball atop that tower.  Granted, in this film the Eyeball has developed the power to sort of roll about, rather like a lighthouse lamp,  but it's still a pretty lame villain.  Here, perhaps more than anywhere, Jackson reveals the limitations of his source material.  In the book, as I recall, Sauron's Eyeball was really more of a psychological entity.  Grasping for any straw, Jackson has made the Eyeball a concrete reality, so that we would have SOMETHING to identify as a villain.  But don't fret:  Sauron's Nose will doubtless turn up in the Extended Edition.  In the meantime, sweet dreams, everyone.

                Though certainly an improvement upon the second film in this already classic trilogy, I must say I am shocked that of all the incredible films I could name right off the top of my head that could be sitting in the fifth position in IMDb's list of Top 250 Highest Rated Films, this is the one that's sitting there. I know I'm quite tardy in my viewing of this movie, and I've known of its sky-high praise for the four or five years it's been in release, and I thought that even though the subject matter, as I explained in my reviews of the preceding two Lord of the Rings films, is not my cup of tea, I would see what everyone else sees in these movies. I was very fond of the first one, I was grateful when I saw the ending credits of the second one, and though I found myself entertained more than the second one by the third one, I was even more grateful when the final credits arrived. I will start with what I liked: The battle sequences in this film were much better than the ones in its predecessor. I thought the second film's battles were lame and this time around, they had a lot of intensity, and I found myself drawn in. Where I found myself riveted was during the climax, the fate of the ring to be determined on a coarse cliff over molting lava, and everything unexpected happens and all of the present characters in the scene have tension that finally culminates and releases, and I finally truly found myself caring about the ring, even if it doesn't make sense that Shalob can stink Frodo through a supposedly impermeable vest.But now, let's get down to brass tacks about the denouement. I have never seen a movie that ends as many times as The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. After awhile, I was counting the ""final"" scenes. Counting! Then, I found myself shocked that I had given up on counting. Who counts endings to one movie? I cannot stand a badly paced film. I've always thought of directors like Peter Jackson as directors who are particularly good at keeping a brisk pace, no matter how long the movie is. But, not only do his endings lag in this single film, but they are plagued further by two horrible things: 1) Every time one ending closes, it fades out and the screen remains black for several seconds. Then it fades up again, having fooled you and the interest that causes you to stay with a film to the end has left. This happens every-single-time-the-movie-makes-you-think-it's-ending. 2) After awhile, this series of endings becomes intensely contrived and meaningless. We don't need to see most of the things that happen! And if Jackson still wants us to see what happens to these characters, as these things must in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, he should pace it better so that it does not feel stretched, tacked on, or contrived. Perfect way to achieve this: Get rid of the deceptive fade-outs!I enjoyed The Fellowship of the Ring, and I suppose the last two films had their moments, but all I can say is that I am glad that I'm finished with this trilogy and that I don't have to worry about seeing them ever again.

                Not surprisingly, a lot of good plot had been removed from the story, and a lot of bad plot inserted. This is hardly news; the same happened to the two predecessors. Much was lost by skipping ""The Scouring of the Shire"". The computer graphics are well-done but rarely convincing, and Gollum's only task is to provide comic relief. Most of the audience seemed to find him quite funny. I was just bored.Tolkien's books told a great story basically about the weakness of men (and other races), and the importance of not fighting alone. The best example being the events on the edge of Mount Doom. Tolkien made a strong point in that nobody is perfect, neither perfectly good nor perfectly evil.The film completely ignores this and simplifies things to pure black and white. There's good, and there's evil, with nothing in-between , no shades of grey.And that I think is sad.All that being said, the film has a few but important qualities, and that's the great camera work, the excellent acting and the stunning scenery - CG-scenery too.The rest of the CG is not that interesting, except for Shelob the spider who really makes up for it. The sound of a whole cinema audience simultaneously gasping in horror as ... Well, I won't spoil for those who haven't read the books. But wow. So, in the end, despite all its flaws, I recommend seeing this film. But go see it now, on the big screen. It won't be worth your time on TV.

(What -- did you think the Dark Lord would win?  that any of the main characters of the Fellowship would actually die?)Apparently, many MORE times, because this 3-1/2-hour trudge is but the appetizer to the main course of the  ""Extended Edition"", New Line's continuing money-grab that will reveal perhaps a FIVE-HOUR version of this movie alone.  (Taken all together, *The Lord of the Rings* -- The Extended Version -- approaches the length of 14 hours, give or take.)  Well, as P. T. Barnum once observed, There's a sucker born every minute, and New Line has found the suckers, who are not only willing to pay at the movie theater, but are also only too willing to fork out exorbitant amounts for  ""special editions""  of movies that ought to have stood on their own -- AS RELEASED. A simple standard should obtain in a movie theater:  what you're seeing on the screen should be what a director wants you to see.  ""Extended-edition DVD's""  don't count, and especially should not be taken in consideration in reviews by either professional critics or by amateur reviewers at places like IMDb.  I can already hear the defenders of the films demur, ""But these movies would've been too long if Jackson didn't cut them into shorter versions!""  But that's precisely my point.  *The Lord of the Rings* remains an unfilmable book:  it's too long; it's too unwieldy.  As far as an adaptation is concerned, none -- not less -- would be more.Which is not to say that there aren't any great filmic moments in *Return of the King*:  the lighting of the watch-fires along the mountain ranges is pure cinema; the entire scene with Frodo and Sam fending off a giant spider in a cobwebby cave is terrific, providing the one suspenseful stretch in the entire movie; and Gollum remains a wonderful creation, a rare successful collaboration of technology and old-fashioned creative virtues.  Taken as a whole, the movie is better than, say, *The Matrix*  or other expensive Hollywood blockbusters of the  ""action-adventure""  genre.  But to say so is not to say much.  The occasional high points don't constitute a comprehensive whole, or make Tolkien's saga any less silly.  It's a book about magic rings, wizards, Dark Lords, and dwarfs, for God's sake.  In *Return of the King*, there's a scene in Minas Tirith where the citizens watch a sad parade of soldiers go by:  but it's comical, because everyone looks like refugees from a Renaissance Faire.  It doesn't do to inflate this material to cosmic levels.  Claims that Tolkien's fantasy was the greatest book of the 20th Century truly make my head spin:  what, was  *Ulysses* chopped liver?  What was the second greatest book -- Stephen King's  *The Stand*?Pardon my long-windedness, but the very subject inspires it.  I'll wrap by lamenting that one of the better elements in the first two installments, Christopher Lee as Saruman, was a victim of the cutting room floor.  Even fans of this material might agree with me that any number of the scenes with Frodo and Sam blubbering at each other would've been better replaced with a coda to the Saruman plot-line.  While others may say, ""Well, he'll be in the Extended-Edition version,""  I'm sure that will be cold comfort to Mr. Lee. At least Saruman was a villain we could sink our teeth into:  in *Return*, we must instead settle for that damned Eyeball atop that tower.  Granted, in this film the Eyeball has developed the power to sort of roll about, rather like a lighthouse lamp,  but it's still a pretty lame villain.  Here, perhaps more than anywhere, Jackson reveals the limitations of his source material.  In the book, as I recall, Sauron's Eyeball was really more of a psychological entity.  Grasping for any straw, Jackson has made the Eyeball a concrete reality, so that we would have SOMETHING to identify as a villain.  But don't fret:  Sauron's Nose will doubtless turn up in the Extended Edition.  In the meantime, sweet dreams, everyone.

                I just saw this movie and I must say that I have mixed reactions to it. While there were moments that I was on the edge of my seat, including powerful charge of the Rohirim (as chill inducing as it was is in the books) and the precarious hobbits dangling high above the Morgul Vale, for the most part I was quite annoyed by either the overwrought, drawn out facial expressions of the actors or the unnecessary changes to the plot. Unlike other die hard fans of the book, I did not miss the  Scouring of the Shire scene, which I always felt was unecessary in the books, and certainly didn't need to be on the screen (which would have only added to the multiple endings, all of which, I might add, are in the books). Also, the change with the whole Gollum/Sam framing thing makes Frodo look stupid and Sam a blubbering baby, which the books definitely do not portray. Frodo keeps Gollum with them because he knows that Gollum knows the way better than they do and would never let Sauron get the ring. He shrewdly uses Gollums lust for the ring and desire to keep it for himself as well has his trust in Sam to protect him from Gollum. He also shares Gandalf's wisdom in being able to see Gollums fate woven into the fate of the ring, therefore woven with his as well. On top of this is his honest desire to attempt to reform Gollum and save him from his misery. This is a key point in the book and yet Jackson somehow managed to mangle it into some simplistic Gollum brainwashing trick. And yet I now understand these plot changes, because they start with Jackson saying ""well, we can't have that scene what if this character did this instead?"" and then all of a sudden you need to change some other bit, to make that change make sense, and then you need to change another bit ... etc until pretty soon the character's motivations are complelely different. Note to Jackson: don't mess with a masterpiece, Tolkien had a few thousand more IQ points and a whole lot more time to perfect his story, don't go astray because you think a particular shot would be ""cool"". Once you start unravelling such a intricate ball of yarn, it's hard to knit the thing all back together again (err, something like that, you get the idea).
Now having said that, the movie could have been much worse, which is something all the naysayers have to remember, a hollywoodised version of this movie would have been The Matrix or some such drivel. Luckily for Jackson though, he had such solid material to go on, and a litle skill, that it would have taken some serious incompetence to completely botch it. At times in the movie I am reminded that Jackson is a relatively inexperienced director, having directed mostly low budget B-movies (Dead Alive anyone?) and so I would give him an A for effort, but what would have happened if he would have teamed up with a more seasoned director to add some weight to many scenes which obviously lacked it (that final shot of Frodo waking up in the bed was downright painful). Please no more slow motion facial expressions, we get the idea, they're sad/angry/happy, you don't have to ""light it up in neon"" as one critic said. A fine effort, and it will gross billions, but far from the masterpiece people claim it to be.

                Before I review this good movie, I have to get something that's been bothering me off my chest.I went with eight people to see ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King."" All eight of them found it ""good"" at best. We all thought it was too long, with too many passages of dialogue explaining what was going to happen (""I ride to Minis Tirith at dawn to face the enemies of Middle-Earth!"" -- just do it already!), too many scenes that most definitely could have been cut or edited, and we all found that the ending of the film stretched on too long and we didn't need to see Frodo and Sam fondly gazing at each other ninety times before we got the idea that they have an affection for each other. (Brotherly love or...something else?)The thing is, all the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies are good. But none of them are great. Filmed by Peter Jackson with an epic feeling that betrays J.R.R. Tolkien's light-hearted tale, the films try to take a somewhat light idea and turn them into epics -- a problem, since the entire world is fantasy, and it is hard to take anything in the film dreadfully serious. (I thought it was just I, but some other critics have noted the same problem.)This is the best ""Lord of the Rings"" movie. Even though it sounds as if I am complaining about them, I am not. I'm complaining about the way movie geeks flock to the cinemas and spread word that it's the ""best film of all time,"" then post these comments on the Internet and try to boost the film's rating on IMDb. (Some fans have been caught in the act of making multiple usernames to do so.)I find it almost laughable that anyone could argue that the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is the best of all time, or that it is the better than ""The Godfather"" (because that film stands as the number one film on the Internet Movie Database, there are heated debates from ""Rings"" fans claiming that ""The Godfather"" is trash and their favorite film is not).It's all opinion, of course, but I sometimes wonder whether the fans of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" those who claim they are superior to ""The Godfather,"" have even seen that film. I also wonder whether the strict fans that claim it is the best film ever made have actually seen enough films to qualify for that assumption -- if it is their favorite film, fine, but to say it is THE best film of all time is entirely their opinion, although they seem to take it as a fact.  Have they seen the films of Fellini? Kurosawa? Scorsese? Coppola? ""Citizen Kane""? ""Casablanca""? ""Taxi Driver""? ""Sweet Smell of Success""? ""To Kill a Mockingbird""? ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""? ""Chinatown""? ""Apocalypse Now""? ""2001: A Space Odyssey""? The list goes on!Their definitions of classics range from the time of ""Star Wars"" to present cinema. It may sound like an old argument but it's true -- greater films are harder to find nowadays, and just because ""The Lord of the Rings"" seems like an achievement of some sort, it does not make it the best film of all time. I can name many better films. But, then again, it's my opinion, I suppose.Now that I'm done with my rant, there's nothing left to say. Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) venture closer to Mordor to destroy The One Ring, while Gollum (Andy Serkis) plots to murder them both and take the Ring of Power for himself. (We get to see Gollum's background in the film, too, which is something that will satisfy Tolkien's fans that have read the stories.)Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) returns to the throne of a kingdom (hence the title of the film) to claim his position as heir of Isildur, but first gathers together Legolas and Gimli (Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies) to help battle the Orcs venturing closer to their castle, along with Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen), who opens a can of whoop [butt] in this movie.This is the darkest film of the trilogy. You may have thought ""The Two Towers"" was dark, but ""The Return of the King"" is almost evil -- Frodo gives audiences the creeps a few times. When he says, ""The Ring is mine,"" and grins at Sam with the Elijah Wood grin, a shiver goes down your spine.The film picks up pace starting with the giant arachnid battle, about halfway through the film, and continues down the path of mild greatness until the last twenty minutes, which never seem to end. It is as if Jackson was afraid to close his film for a final time and kept dragging the scenes out -- I don't need to see Frodo and Sam admiring each other more than twice!As the credits rolled, the audience poured out of the theater. ""Wasn't that good?"" I heard someone say. ""No,"" was the reply. ""The Return of the King"" is a very good film, and certainly the best of the trilogy, but don't be fooled by the hype -- this is not one of the best films of all time. It's a case of the Emperor's New Clothes -- some day, someone's going to realize that what they're going on about isn't really there at all. And finally all the film fans will be able to say, ""Y'know, I never really loved the movie all that much anyway."" But for now, I guess we'll all have to put up with more unearned hype. I liked this movie. I liked it a lot at certain points. But I would never, ever call it great. That's just me, I guess.4.5/5 stars.John Ulmer

                I fought to give this a 10 (as I did). I loved the first two movies as much as I could love movies. Unlike many others, I was unfamiliar with Tolkien's work going into these, and I'm glad I was. What an absolute cinematic experience this trilogy was without knowing what was to come. (I've since read everything Tolkien and that has dulled the movies a bit for me, but how could it not!)RotK was the lesser of the three for me - only because I felt cheated in the battle that the prior movies were building up for... why did it have to be a ghost army... I was extremely disappointed with having a green CGI mob wipe out the enemy. Later I learned that the green ghosts weren't even in the original book for this battle!After the triumph that was the battle of Helms Deep, I had such high expectations for the battle of Gondor. Expectations that were met until it's anticlimactic conclusion...
However that is a ""me"" problem, and this series was the best cinematic experience I've had to date (2021)!

                I knew it would be good, but this takes the entire cake.  Peter Jackson has absolutely outdone himself with this masterpiece.  True, there are a few tiny holes in the plot, but they are easily overlooked.  Even if you're not a huge fan of Tolkien, you should really make an attempt to see this movie.  I wasn't a fan of the books, but Jackson's movies have inspired me to pick them up and give them all a good read.  Can't wait for the DVD. Let's see if Jackson does as good a job with The Hobbit.

                I still don't like these films, but this was the least intolerable of the three.  I think it had the greatest departures from the books in plot, but was perhaps the closest to the books in meaning.  I'm not even talking about all the characters and events left out; there's lots of stuff here that never happened in the book.The acting is sometimes painful.  Frodo and Sam are particularly given to intervals of mawkishness.  Gimli is shamefully used for comic relief.  The dialogue's just horrible; exposition is awkward (""A diversion!"") - I suspect the actors are giving the director what he's asked for, it's the director and writers I question.  Anyway, the adults come out okay except Eomer, reduced to mere grimacing in the background.  It's the little people who suffer.Visuals are often not to my taste, but are impressive.  Frodo always glows. Everything hobbity is very golden-lit and twinkly and twee - I think that's the worst setting mistake.  Hobbits should be those we identify with most closely, not those we're distanced from.  Minas Tirith is barely glimpsed before it's overrun by the Goths and Visigoths; Edoras outshines it.I don't like the battle scenes.  Cuts to show the sea of Orcs menacing a small city of troop of Men are unimpressive after so many repetitions, and the fighting scenes are very rapidly cut and look kinda undercranked and unfocussed, especially when using lots of CG troops.  Necessary perhaps, but it still looks bad.What was right?  They made a great scene of the lighting of the signal fires, and the relay from hill to hill, though it went on too long.  The songs were good.  The human kings rallying their troops to hopeless battles were actually magnificent.  Gandalf was less the remote magician and more the humanized power than in the first two movies.  The tone is more epic than in the first two installments - they seemed to use scale of battles and scale of scenery as a substitute for theme and pace.  ROTK didn't make me look at my watch nearly as much as FOTR and TTT.  And there's more Viggo, whom I love, but he may not be quite as good.  *sigh*Anyway, it's still pretty crummy.  Gak!  Also, I think this one would be _very_ hard to understand without having read the books or seen the first two - I wished I'd refreshed my memory of the previous movie before watching this.

                I'm beginning to agree with the viewers who remarked that this movie is overrated. Overrated, indeed. I have never been a big fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.I admit, the first movie was visually stunning and used some novel techniques for example, to make characters appear much larger than others as actors moved with the cameras to sustain the illusions. It was really something different that came out at the time, especially considering the number of awful movies produced in the mainstream that year, Lord of the Rings really found a good following in a period of utter cinematic slump (at least among the mainstream and partly in the independent features). I think those idiots at the Academy Awards were dumb to pass up recognizing it for one of the top awards that year, probably best director if nothing else. As the first in the series, I think it was given the best treatment as far as writing, visuals, and editing (which would be the bain of the remaining two in the trilogy), and everything else. Again, it was a refreshing change in mainstream films that year, and certainly one well-deserving of the recognition.But the remaining two films, the Two Towers and now, Return of the King, were disappointing for one major reason: there was never enough in the movies (I don't know about the book) to sustain two movies at lengths of three hours or more each (not to mention the additional ""bonus"" footage feature on the DVDs). Someone here must've been so proud of their CGI creations and the time and money spent developing the sets that they must've felt like it was just bad manners to leave most of it on the cutting room floor. There is far too much repetition going on in the remaining too movies that could've easily have been made into one three hour film, rather than two.The Two Towers spent an ungodly amount of time with those epic battle scenes between the billions and billions of Uruk soldiers and the few good-willed soldiers lead by Aragon and others. I found myself aching for the movie to be over with, and was sadly disappointed considering my interest in the first one. We are left with a story of fleeting interest: Sam and Frodo on their journey to toss the ring in the fire (though the introduction of Gollum, that ugly little bugger, was quite an interesting part of the story), Aragon and his gang were out to battle the relentless Uruk army, and Merry and Pippin literally got to be tree hugging hobbits. If the filmmakers didn't worry so much about pleasing the audience with epic CGI battle scenes and concentrated on developing each separate story of the various characters in their journies, it probably would've been a much better film. Although, considering that the third movie, 'Return of the King,' contained a nauseating amount of repetition as far as the story, and dragging on time with endless amounts of boring, dreamy dialogue and even more endless battle scenes, I still think it should've been combined into one movie.
Not only endless dialogue of the fortune tellers and soothsayers, but also an ending that never seemed to end. Once again, it was like the filmmakers tried several things and liked every single ending and just stuck every single one in the movie, whether it was relevant or not (such as Sam and his hobbit daughters or the 'Wizard of Oz' ending where Elijah Wood puts on his queerest happy voice as he greets his friends 'round the bedside). The viewer who suggested that they should of ended it after the coronation was right, there was no need to drag on the movie for another half-hour of fade-ins and fade-outs of one happy ending after the next, as they did enough stalling throughout most of the movies, anyways.Return of the King is definitely overrated and was hardly deserving of the 'Best Picture' Oscar, nor for every other Oscar it snagged this year, leaving little to be anticipated during the awards knowing that the Lord of the Rings team would win whatever award was announced. The Academy was stupid for not recognizing it with top awards the first time around, and instead, waited for the third anti-climatic cult fest to finally give Jackson and his crew their dues. There were far better movies nominated for Best Picture and nearly every other award this year (save the special effects nominations).Once again, though, I do think that Peter Jackson and his crew did good with their efforts to recreate Tolkein's stories cinematically. That kind of undertaking for a trilogy filmed simultaneously over 18 months is quite incredible. I just though that, save for the Fellowhip of the Rings, the filmmakers failed to capitalize on the things that would've made the remaining two films in the trilogy something really great, especially if they weren't so bogged down in special effects and cheesy dialogue.

                The third installment of the Lord of the Rings was a good movie, however, I had many problems with the character development and acting in the movie. Sean Astin and Elijah Wood, (the only two exceptions,) played the roles of Frodo and Samwise admirably.  Even with some of the adaptations from Peter Jackson's interpretation of the books, the story is still intriguing. However, none of the other characters in the remaining part of the fellowship suffered no more than 3 seconds of any kind of acting at a time, as nearly all the dialogue from the book is erased.  And at the ending sequence, when Frodo wakes up, the cheerful scenes drag on forever, when Peter Jackson could have saved it by cutting off half the slow motion and instead, showing the last parts of the book with the burning & enslavement of the shire, and the uprising that followed.  All in all, it was a good movie.  Cinematic, epic, and, above all, bloody.

                Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is no doubt the best movie I've seen. The film captures you instantly up to the words ""The End"" appearing on the screen. The Return of the King is nothing short of excitement.For all those who doesn't know what The Lord of the Rings is about (I'm thinking everybody does either through the books or the movies), here's a brief summary: Just over 50 year ago, J.R.R. Tolkien published a tale about a long, dangerous quest to destroy 1 ring. This tale is split into 3 novels, ""The Fellowship of the Rings"", ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"". This tale, is called ""The Lord of the Rings"". Nearly 50 years after the novels were published, Peter Jackson tells the tale in another way, by bringing it to life onto the big screen.This tale is about 9 people's quest to destroy one magic ring and return peace to Middle-Earth. If this one ring goes back to it's maker, the evil Sauron, the world will be under his control, bringing death and misery everywhere. The only way to destroy this powerful ring is to cast it into the fires of Mount Doom, where it was made. Only one hobbit could resist the temptation to keep the ring and this job was given to a hobbit named Frodo Baggins. To help him along the way, a fellowship of nine people were brought together. In it was a wizard, 2 men, an elf, a dwarf and three other hobbits. Together, they set out for Mordor, where Mount Doom is situated. Getting to Mordor is not as easy as it sounds. On the way they'll have to battle Orcs, Uruk-hais, giant spiders and other results of Tolkien's fascinating imagination.The Return of the King is the last addition to this vast trilogy. Peter Jackson does a great job in interpreting Tolkien's thoughts and feelings into a film. Watching the movies is just like reading the books themselves. If it was only the movies, it wouldn't have made such an impact on the public. The music in all three films practically takes you on your very own journey and the acting from the actors was also very impressive. If anything was missing from these movies, they just wouldn't have been such a success. Peter Jackson has done this to perfection.Overall, this is a must-watch movie. Plenty of action and special effects, not to mention a very heart warming ending to the trilogy. I'll just say one more thing, don't criticise anything until you have saw, heard or done it, especially Lord of the Rings.

","UACW","12 January 2006",NA,"
                It's fantastic that someone finally succeeded in bring Tolkien to the big screen like this, and it took fantastic planning, and Jackson is deserving of every award he's received - and he should have received more.But there comes a time when CGI gets so close to but yet so far from reality that everything looks like a cartoon animated by van Gogh. I think these movies go too far without having much of a choice.The first part was enthralling because it was finally happening, and the Ringwraith were fantastic. The second part surprised by the emotion it invoked - it had all the flurry of a Lucas attempt at an epic but it had guts and grit too. And Jackson made his cast look earthy and human, and he introduced hormones into things that seem absent in the book(s).And it's a fantastic conclusion to be sure, but as with Titanic, the achievement is first and foremost that it happened and that it was a success. There is no way Jackson can get enough acclaim or recognition for what he has done.All I've got to say is I don't especially appreciate all these special effects. They come closer and closer to looking real but they will never be convincing. Serkis is amazing of course, and he should have received some sort of award. But there comes a time when the fantasy of the mind is better than trying to paint the impossible on screen.A lot of people will laud the movie because the effects were so good; this doesn't have squat to do with the quality of the movie. Like saying James Bond's Aston Martin is cool, therefore Connery/Lazenby/Moore/Dalton/Brosnan are good actors.No one can take away from Jackson what he did: a major achievement, a milestone in cinematic and cultural history. But I wasn't overly impressed, and in fact found myself looking at my watch wondering when it would all finally be over. Maybe I was satisfied the movie had made it and lost interest because I already knew the ending; maybe it was the plethora of CGI wizardry that had me longing for Wiley Coyote and his Roadrunner friend.At least there no one's trying to fool you into thinking it's real.

                This movie could really use an EE -- BADLY.  Characters are just picked up and discarded (Eomer, in particular), Eowyn's battle with the Witch King will, with luck, be expanded.  It was over before I knew it and the editing was shabby.  Too many oliphaunts and CGI, atrocious battle tactics on the part of the Rohirrim (sure, charge into a head of 10 story beasts even though we have bows and arrows and can shoot from a distance - sounds good!), meaningless inventions (Arwen's life tied to Ring, the Arwen ""to leave or not to leave"" flip flop, the Lembas Conspiracy, and that stupid Legolas-Oliphaunt trick), a limp confrontation scene with the king of the dead, no resolution to Saruman (the main bad guy of the first two films, if you've forgotten), and the worst hatchet job on an established fictional character (Denethor, Denethor, Denethor).  Horrible, horrible.  Plus a cheesy bed-jumping scene and coronation where the cheddar flowed in abundance.  It was a mess that I hope the EE will mend somewhat, but there's a lot to fix. A LOT.  A disappointing end to a trilogy that began with a masterpiece in FOTR.On the plus side, David Wenham, Billy Boyd and Sean Astin.  They were brilliant and made it worth spending the money to see it once.  Their performances were true and heartfelt, though Faramir sadly dropped out of the picture because PJ unwisely cut the Houses of Healing sequence.It's not worth the hype and I didn't think this once in a lifetime film event would end so sadly.

                To keep rating simple for my vote, let's just say that I'll give this film 9/10, but don't ask me what I'd say for what's lacking, for I wouldn't know what to say. It's a generously long film, no commercial breaks, if a person wants to call those interruptions breaks anyway, and I definitely am not qualified to criticize this film in any respect. Still, I'll give 9/10 rather than 10/10, to be conservative, say. :)People should, however, learn the basics of the story before seeing this film in order to get the most satisfaction from it. I read Tolkien's story in book form and later saw the three-part film for LOTR. So, seeing this film directed by Peter Jackson, I had no pre-study to do. One thing viewers need to know is the importance of the ring. I guess that it is the most elementary part of the story. Otherwise, people can naturally wonder what the fuss is about a ring even if it appears to be made of gold. If it's supposed to be gold, then that's not what's important about it. What is, is the magical or mystical power that it provides to whoever is wearing it and that this power is related, say, to evil. This becomes obvious in this film, but only far into it.Great film though.

                I think those that have described both this movie and the trilogy as the 'greatest ever' should go back to their video games.  In time, all three of these movies will take their rightful place in film history...oblivion. 
I can't understand how people can equate special effects with great film making.  There's really nothing positive that I can say about these movies except that the special effects were at first stunning.  Soon their repetitiveness led to utter boredom.I would much rather watch a film about realistic situations that people can actually relate to.  But I guess if you spent your entire life playing video games and watching other special effects based movies like these, then these movies would qualify as the greatest ever.Someone made the comment that this movie was better than Citizen Kane. Watch this movie as many times as Citizen Kane and see which holds up better.  Believe me, this whole trilogy will be a fading memory in ten or twenty years and Citizen Kane will continue to be praised.  This is just another case of the 'dumbing down' of the culture.  These same people probably can't wait until the next Superbowl so they can watch the commercials.I generously gave all three movies of this trilogy a 5/10.

                I went to see ROTK for the 2nd time yesterday and aside from the myriad of minor flaws, want to concentrate on major issues surrounding Jackson's character development.ARAGORN is the first big problem. In the book he is both a ranger from the north, but also a man destined to be king. He knows who he is, and he has an expectation of that destiny. Likewise in the book he has 'spiritual' awareness. Aragorn is descended, not merely from men, but from Numenor: so he already has in him some of the blood of the Elves. Now Jackson gives all foresight to the Elves - making the men merely, men. But the whole point is that the-man-born-to-be-king has the spiritual awareness of the great kings of old. Thus, in book II at the river it is Aragorn, not Legolas (as in Jackson's version), who is aware of a shadow growing in his heart. And, more significantly, it is Aragorn who in the book takes the palantir by his right (Gandalf actually bows to give it to him). Gandalf counsels him not to use it, but Aragorn knows who he is. So he looks in the palantir and shows Sauron the sword. He challenges Sauron, and then wrenches the palantir away from the Eye to use as HE wills, not as Sauron wills. In so doing he sees the black fleet, and so knows the threat. That's why he takes the path of the dead. And when he goes under the Dimholt he REALLY summons the dead. The exchange in the film between Aragorn and the Geoffrey-Rush-Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-look-alike ghost is feeble in the film. In the book Aragorn does not doubt who he is: he calls them, not barters with them.Now Aragorn's action here is part of a much larger cohesion in Tolkien that is entirely absent in Jackson. As a result we're left with a desperately anti-climactic coronation. Why? There's simply been no character development of Aragorn. He's been denuded of a sense of who he is.SAURON is the next big problem. It's true that in the book he is mostly referred to as the Eye. But he also has personality. In the film, apart from the opening sequence to film I (which was brilliant) all we have is a plasma lamp sometime searchlight. Since in the book Gandalf has told Frodo that 'Sauron is taking shape again' why on earth didn't Jackson then develop Sauron from the figure in film I? In the book, we are told of Sauron's gnawing doubt. We hear of reports about 'spies' entering Mordor. We know that he is consumed by fear of the upstart heir of Elendil. None of this is developed in the film. (And the Ring seems to lose power on entering Mordor, not gain it!) Result? There was no sense of elation at the fall of Barad'dur.Now this is a serious theological error that I suspect Tolkien would have detested. Personify good, and you must also personify evil. Tolkien's epic was all about those forces being personified: and how you discern them. Sauron is a personification of evil. He's not actually the worst - that belongs to Morgoth (of whom the Balrog is a servant). Whilst Tolkien rightly loathed allegory, he nonetheless never would have countenanced such a weak and ineffectual portrayal of the enemy. The whole point, and if this isn't obvious in the world today then Jackson is even less astute than I imagined, is that evil in many guises takes human form.OTHERSThe same lack of characterisation in Aragorn and Sauron goes on with many of the others. Notable exceptions are GANDALF and SARUMAN (both well acted). Jackson made a mistake in cutting Saruman out of III having made so much of him in I and II (more than the book). ARWEN is drippy throughout. EOWYN is changed in the film. Miranda Otto was excellent. But Jackson plays up the love between her and Aragorn so much that we are left wondering how Eowyn is apparently beatifically happy to see him with Arwen. On the subject of Eowyn it's such a shame Jackson didn't do the slaying of the witch-king better. In the book the battlefield pauses - a cloud goes up and everyone in Minas Tirith is happy. It's one of the truly great moments, lost by Jackson. The reports even leak back to the orcs in the tower above Shelob's lair so that Sam and Frodo hear that 'No.1. has been done in'.As for the HOBBITS . I think this may be a question of preference. Personally I think Sean Astin's acting as SAM is execrable, but some like it. For me, the simple gardener becomes a mini-philosopher and I find his soliloquy both at the end of film II in Osgiliath (to which they never go in the book) and on the mountain (twice) truly toe-curlingly dreadful: pap I'm afraid. And, oh dear, we even veered towards Titanic-music-moments at the end of film I and again on the mountain. BILBO was fine until the end. Yes, we know he ages fast now he's lost the ring, but the Salieri-style prosthetics are poor. Jackson loves the slow-motion work so much that we have to endure some particularly dreadful sequences with the Hobbits (most notably the already infamous bed scene) and at the end (where I really thought Frodo was going to give Sam a full-on smacker!). A similarly tacky piece of directing occurs when the elves appear - the soft focus lens is deployed with 'celtic' singing. Argh -  this is kindergarten film production.I expect the film will garner the Oscars ceremony. But I hope some people in Tinsel town have the courage to acknowledge that whilst some of the visuals are outstanding (though many are not - e.g. the oliphaunt descent by Legolas, the Merrick-style leader of the orcs, and the Army of the dead), the film is not actually very good.Peter - I'm afraid you've let us, and J.R.R. Tolkien, down.

                The perfect end to a magnificent trilogy, Return of the King is one of the best fantasy films ever made. The story concludes with poignant payoffs set up in the first two installments. Each character has their moment to shine and there is true growth in each of their narratives.The setting is gorgeous (I want to live at Minas Tirith), the score is profound (especially in the third act) and the story is well balanced. The script is incredibly well written and the slick dialogue is performed masterfully. From ""I am no man"" to ""For Frodo!"" to ""My lady!"" and many more, there are chill-inducing moments due to smart writing.While it is emotionally draining to complete the trilogy, it is equally fulfilling. There is a lot packed into these 10 hours of film (non-extended editions). Though long and complicated, Return of the King wraps up the best trilogy ever made with elegance.Best Character: Samwise Gamgee (Top 5 most selfless character in all of cinema)
Best Moment: The ""My friends, you bow to no one"" scene
Best Quote: ""I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you!"" - Sam.

                The Return of the King is the renowned final chapter in Peter Jackson's legendary Lord of The Rings film trilogy. The films in this trilogy are widely considered to be some of the greatest fantasy films ever made.It is a testament to the quality of Return of the King that it is without a doubt the best film in the trilogy. The story, characters, world building, and cinematography all combine to create one of the most magnificent franchise finales of all time.The Return of the King boasts an emotionally powerful and moving story of how sheer perseverance, love, loyalty, and friendship are more important qualities than mere physical strength. It also brilliantly showcases how even the smallest person can accomplish great feats of heroism and courage. These were always the core themes of Lord of the Rings and this film makes sure they take center stage in the narrative.The story is also brilliantly grounded in human emotion which makes for a very emotionally stirring watch. Many of the most powerful scenes in the film are after the great battles have died down and the characters share intimate, bittersweet, and touching moments with each other. Some of these moments are enough to bring tears from nearly anyone's eyes.This timeless story is elevated by what can only be described as a near flawless cast. The amount of acting talent on display here is astounding with greats like Sir lan Mckellen, Viggo Mortensen, Andy Serkis, Karl Urban, and Orlando Bloom all giving memorable acting performances in an enormous ensemble cast. The performances of this top notch cast perfectly bring the characters to life and help to immerse the audience into the film's captivating world.The Return of the King's spectacular visuals are some of the finest in the history of blockbuster filmmaking. The larger than life cinematography vividly conveys the unimaginable vastness of Middle Earth. Grand sweeping shots of mountain ranges, nearly endless fields, volcanoes, gigantic ancient cities, and other arresting vistas are shown with stunning detail. The way Jackson effortlessly blends CGI locales with real places in these shots is astonishing and something I have not seen done nearly as well in any other movie outside of the other Lord of the Rings films.On the subject of CGI, the special effects work for this film is truly state of the art. The impossibly realistic motion capture on Gollum's face, along with the marvellously sinister monster and creature designs are both impressive to behold.This great special effects work and the audacious cinematography both work in perfect union during any of The Return of the King's jaw dropping battle sequences. The battles in this film simply must be seen to be believed. I do not speak lightly when I say that Return of The King has some of the most epic, breathtaking, and blood pumping battle scenes in movie history. Peter Jackson's excellent direction and the overwhelming visual spectacle of these scenes are enough to make them endlessly exciting on every re-watch.These unbelievable action sequences are enhanced further by a chilling and awe inspiring musical score by composer Howard Shore. This phenomenal soundtrack also permeates the film's more quiet character moments too where it is serene and beautiful to listen to. It works wonders to elevate these scenes as wellOverall, The Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King is one of the purest examples of an emotional rollercoaster you will find in American Cinema. It can make you cry, cheer, and smile like almost no other film. It is a timeless grand epic and a true landmark in the fantasy film genre.

                Just wow!This movie is just mind-blowing in every aspect-the climax, the battles, the cinematography and effects, everything! I don't usually cry watching movies anymore, but man, this one shook me. All the characters you've come to grow and love are finally pitted together for one last glorious finale, and it couldn't have been better.The lore and story of this series is so richly detailed and magical yet fits perfectly in the trilogy, and The Return of the King is easily the greatest adaption of the three. The odds are finally stacked here in the endgame and who dies does die for good.This movie is easily in my top three favorites of all time and stands as an ultimate epic of one of the greatest stories of good vs evil of all time!

                Well, I think I said in my review of TTT that I was afraid that Jackson and company wouldn't be able to fit in all that was left. Now, though I have not seen the extended cut (longer than the cut of _Napoleon_, I believe!), it looks like they added much of it back there.As a Tolkien geek of 30+ years I was greatly impressed by these films even though I miss much of the subtlety of the book itself. However, that subtlety is not entirely lost; instead, it is often taken up in the acting. Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto actually make *more* of their characters than the books do. All of the Hobbits are fine, Andy Serkis is better than fine, and Ian Holm, bless him, gives all the young ones lessons in sly scene stealing. Ian McKellen is a bit too subdued at times, but when he hits the mark he's very powerful. Elves are basically impossible to play, but all of the actors in those roles do well even if Orlando Bloom is a bit callow.The revelation throughout all three films, though, is Viggo Mortensen. I hated him immediately upon his entrance in the first film, then quickly started to reassess as the film moved on. I quickly realized that he managed to hit every single one of even the deepest notes of the character, a man who is not only skilled beyond his first appearance but whose nature as a hero and a king is based in millennia of history and inheritance. It is an amazing performance, one of the best I have ever seen, and so strong that even though the end of the film was naturally without him I missed his character, just as I do every time I read the book.So, enjoy the CGI. But watch the acting - that's where you'll get the depth of the tale.

                Antipodean director Peter Jackson here proves beyond doubt that he's picked up Spielberg's mantle as the director most competent at blending dazzling special effects with convincing emotional drama. The third part of Jackson's opus sees the One Ring return to Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit, while the hordes of Gorgoroth sweep into the realm of man in their tens of thousands. Bad Taste this ain't.This is the boldest of the three movies in that it necessarily must take the most risks in depicting Tolkien's universe. It's a delicate balancing act. For instance, some will love the Jackson of old re-emerging for the Paths of the Dead sequence, while others will resent its Temple of Doom comedy-horror stylings. Legolas skipping up the leg of an olyphaunt and then sliding down its trunk as it falls: fanboys loathe that stuff; the kids love it. But thankfully, due to Return of the King's structure - a series of action scenes built around Gandalf's (Ian McKellen) dreadful narration - one doesn't have to wait long until the next set-piece arrives. And we're spoiled for choice. Gandalf, for example, doesn't only narrate - he also, exhilaratingly, sweeps onto the plain of Pelennor to ward off the Nazgul with a blinding shaft of light. Shelob doesn't disappoint; Weta have created a memorable monster who tickles the neck-hairs of Tolkien devotees and unsuspecting arachnophobics alike (I had not yet read the novel at this point...). And the lighting of the beacons, erupting from far snow-capped peaks, calling to Gondor under the bellowing strains of Howard Shore's aptly triumphant score, might be the single most rousing sequence in movie history. It's the ignition of hope, a glimmer of unbridled joy before the darkness descends.The biggest omission from the novel is the Scouring of the Shire. I happen to agree with the screenwriters' decision. By that time, we've already had two or three endings. We've been stuffed with a veritable feast in the form of the Battle of Pelennor and the Fall of Sauron; the Scouring, I believe, would have been an unwanted dessert. Besides, Tolkien's epilogue was something of a matter of celebrity. Aragorn's final words to the hobbits, as all of Middle Earth kneels, says more about the height of their standing than any Shire-war would.Some minor flaws still remain. Legolas and Gimli's character arcs still reach no real resolution (but then, do we really need another two endings?). The position of the Battle of Pelennor in the story's narrative doesn't really lend itself to the classical Hollywood narrative very comfortably - there's a predictable, albeit only slight, feeling of 'winding down' in all that follows. Also, on this extended DVD, the point at which we are asked to change discs comes at a most inopportune time, as the drums of war are at their peak.But it seems strangely impertinent to sniff out the trilogy's few flaws; to do so is like picking at the hem of the Bayeux Tapestry. Will we ever see such a wholly satisfying series of films again? Not in my lifetime. (N.B. The score is for all three.) This is pure cinema. Jackson and his creative family just don't stop giving. He has successfully translated his love for his source material and created a body of work that will live on and become equally loved. The scope of his achievement is undeniable; as entertainment, this is about as close to perfection as cinema will get.

                I just saw this movie and I must say that I have mixed reactions to it. While there were moments that I was on the edge of my seat, including powerful charge of the Rohirim (as chill inducing as it was is in the books) and the precarious hobbits dangling high above the Morgul Vale, for the most part I was quite annoyed by either the overwrought, drawn out facial expressions of the actors or the unnecessary changes to the plot. Unlike other die hard fans of the book, I did not miss the  Scouring of the Shire scene, which I always felt was unecessary in the books, and certainly didn't need to be on the screen (which would have only added to the multiple endings, all of which, I might add, are in the books). Also, the change with the whole Gollum/Sam framing thing makes Frodo look stupid and Sam a blubbering baby, which the books definitely do not portray. Frodo keeps Gollum with them because he knows that Gollum knows the way better than they do and would never let Sauron get the ring. He shrewdly uses Gollums lust for the ring and desire to keep it for himself as well has his trust in Sam to protect him from Gollum. He also shares Gandalf's wisdom in being able to see Gollums fate woven into the fate of the ring, therefore woven with his as well. On top of this is his honest desire to attempt to reform Gollum and save him from his misery. This is a key point in the book and yet Jackson somehow managed to mangle it into some simplistic Gollum brainwashing trick. And yet I now understand these plot changes, because they start with Jackson saying ""well, we can't have that scene what if this character did this instead?"" and then all of a sudden you need to change some other bit, to make that change make sense, and then you need to change another bit ... etc until pretty soon the character's motivations are complelely different. Note to Jackson: don't mess with a masterpiece, Tolkien had a few thousand more IQ points and a whole lot more time to perfect his story, don't go astray because you think a particular shot would be ""cool"". Once you start unravelling such a intricate ball of yarn, it's hard to knit the thing all back together again (err, something like that, you get the idea).
Now having said that, the movie could have been much worse, which is something all the naysayers have to remember, a hollywoodised version of this movie would have been The Matrix or some such drivel. Luckily for Jackson though, he had such solid material to go on, and a litle skill, that it would have taken some serious incompetence to completely botch it. At times in the movie I am reminded that Jackson is a relatively inexperienced director, having directed mostly low budget B-movies (Dead Alive anyone?) and so I would give him an A for effort, but what would have happened if he would have teamed up with a more seasoned director to add some weight to many scenes which obviously lacked it (that final shot of Frodo waking up in the bed was downright painful). Please no more slow motion facial expressions, we get the idea, they're sad/angry/happy, you don't have to ""light it up in neon"" as one critic said. A fine effort, and it will gross billions, but far from the masterpiece people claim it to be.

                Before I review this good movie, I have to get something that's been bothering me off my chest.I went with eight people to see ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King."" All eight of them found it ""good"" at best. We all thought it was too long, with too many passages of dialogue explaining what was going to happen (""I ride to Minis Tirith at dawn to face the enemies of Middle-Earth!"" -- just do it already!), too many scenes that most definitely could have been cut or edited, and we all found that the ending of the film stretched on too long and we didn't need to see Frodo and Sam fondly gazing at each other ninety times before we got the idea that they have an affection for each other. (Brotherly love or...something else?)The thing is, all the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies are good. But none of them are great. Filmed by Peter Jackson with an epic feeling that betrays J.R.R. Tolkien's light-hearted tale, the films try to take a somewhat light idea and turn them into epics -- a problem, since the entire world is fantasy, and it is hard to take anything in the film dreadfully serious. (I thought it was just I, but some other critics have noted the same problem.)This is the best ""Lord of the Rings"" movie. Even though it sounds as if I am complaining about them, I am not. I'm complaining about the way movie geeks flock to the cinemas and spread word that it's the ""best film of all time,"" then post these comments on the Internet and try to boost the film's rating on IMDb. (Some fans have been caught in the act of making multiple usernames to do so.)I find it almost laughable that anyone could argue that the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy is the best of all time, or that it is the better than ""The Godfather"" (because that film stands as the number one film on the Internet Movie Database, there are heated debates from ""Rings"" fans claiming that ""The Godfather"" is trash and their favorite film is not).It's all opinion, of course, but I sometimes wonder whether the fans of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" those who claim they are superior to ""The Godfather,"" have even seen that film. I also wonder whether the strict fans that claim it is the best film ever made have actually seen enough films to qualify for that assumption -- if it is their favorite film, fine, but to say it is THE best film of all time is entirely their opinion, although they seem to take it as a fact.  Have they seen the films of Fellini? Kurosawa? Scorsese? Coppola? ""Citizen Kane""? ""Casablanca""? ""Taxi Driver""? ""Sweet Smell of Success""? ""To Kill a Mockingbird""? ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""? ""Chinatown""? ""Apocalypse Now""? ""2001: A Space Odyssey""? The list goes on!Their definitions of classics range from the time of ""Star Wars"" to present cinema. It may sound like an old argument but it's true -- greater films are harder to find nowadays, and just because ""The Lord of the Rings"" seems like an achievement of some sort, it does not make it the best film of all time. I can name many better films. But, then again, it's my opinion, I suppose.Now that I'm done with my rant, there's nothing left to say. Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) venture closer to Mordor to destroy The One Ring, while Gollum (Andy Serkis) plots to murder them both and take the Ring of Power for himself. (We get to see Gollum's background in the film, too, which is something that will satisfy Tolkien's fans that have read the stories.)Meanwhile, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) returns to the throne of a kingdom (hence the title of the film) to claim his position as heir of Isildur, but first gathers together Legolas and Gimli (Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies) to help battle the Orcs venturing closer to their castle, along with Gandalf the White (Ian McKellen), who opens a can of whoop [butt] in this movie.This is the darkest film of the trilogy. You may have thought ""The Two Towers"" was dark, but ""The Return of the King"" is almost evil -- Frodo gives audiences the creeps a few times. When he says, ""The Ring is mine,"" and grins at Sam with the Elijah Wood grin, a shiver goes down your spine.The film picks up pace starting with the giant arachnid battle, about halfway through the film, and continues down the path of mild greatness until the last twenty minutes, which never seem to end. It is as if Jackson was afraid to close his film for a final time and kept dragging the scenes out -- I don't need to see Frodo and Sam admiring each other more than twice!As the credits rolled, the audience poured out of the theater. ""Wasn't that good?"" I heard someone say. ""No,"" was the reply. ""The Return of the King"" is a very good film, and certainly the best of the trilogy, but don't be fooled by the hype -- this is not one of the best films of all time. It's a case of the Emperor's New Clothes -- some day, someone's going to realize that what they're going on about isn't really there at all. And finally all the film fans will be able to say, ""Y'know, I never really loved the movie all that much anyway."" But for now, I guess we'll all have to put up with more unearned hype. I liked this movie. I liked it a lot at certain points. But I would never, ever call it great. That's just me, I guess.4.5/5 stars.John Ulmer

                I fought to give this a 10 (as I did). I loved the first two movies as much as I could love movies. Unlike many others, I was unfamiliar with Tolkien's work going into these, and I'm glad I was. What an absolute cinematic experience this trilogy was without knowing what was to come. (I've since read everything Tolkien and that has dulled the movies a bit for me, but how could it not!)RotK was the lesser of the three for me - only because I felt cheated in the battle that the prior movies were building up for... why did it have to be a ghost army... I was extremely disappointed with having a green CGI mob wipe out the enemy. Later I learned that the green ghosts weren't even in the original book for this battle!After the triumph that was the battle of Helms Deep, I had such high expectations for the battle of Gondor. Expectations that were met until it's anticlimactic conclusion...
However that is a ""me"" problem, and this series was the best cinematic experience I've had to date (2021)!

                I knew it would be good, but this takes the entire cake.  Peter Jackson has absolutely outdone himself with this masterpiece.  True, there are a few tiny holes in the plot, but they are easily overlooked.  Even if you're not a huge fan of Tolkien, you should really make an attempt to see this movie.  I wasn't a fan of the books, but Jackson's movies have inspired me to pick them up and give them all a good read.  Can't wait for the DVD. Let's see if Jackson does as good a job with The Hobbit.

                I still don't like these films, but this was the least intolerable of the three.  I think it had the greatest departures from the books in plot, but was perhaps the closest to the books in meaning.  I'm not even talking about all the characters and events left out; there's lots of stuff here that never happened in the book.The acting is sometimes painful.  Frodo and Sam are particularly given to intervals of mawkishness.  Gimli is shamefully used for comic relief.  The dialogue's just horrible; exposition is awkward (""A diversion!"") - I suspect the actors are giving the director what he's asked for, it's the director and writers I question.  Anyway, the adults come out okay except Eomer, reduced to mere grimacing in the background.  It's the little people who suffer.Visuals are often not to my taste, but are impressive.  Frodo always glows. Everything hobbity is very golden-lit and twinkly and twee - I think that's the worst setting mistake.  Hobbits should be those we identify with most closely, not those we're distanced from.  Minas Tirith is barely glimpsed before it's overrun by the Goths and Visigoths; Edoras outshines it.I don't like the battle scenes.  Cuts to show the sea of Orcs menacing a small city of troop of Men are unimpressive after so many repetitions, and the fighting scenes are very rapidly cut and look kinda undercranked and unfocussed, especially when using lots of CG troops.  Necessary perhaps, but it still looks bad.What was right?  They made a great scene of the lighting of the signal fires, and the relay from hill to hill, though it went on too long.  The songs were good.  The human kings rallying their troops to hopeless battles were actually magnificent.  Gandalf was less the remote magician and more the humanized power than in the first two movies.  The tone is more epic than in the first two installments - they seemed to use scale of battles and scale of scenery as a substitute for theme and pace.  ROTK didn't make me look at my watch nearly as much as FOTR and TTT.  And there's more Viggo, whom I love, but he may not be quite as good.  *sigh*Anyway, it's still pretty crummy.  Gak!  Also, I think this one would be _very_ hard to understand without having read the books or seen the first two - I wished I'd refreshed my memory of the previous movie before watching this.

                I'm beginning to agree with the viewers who remarked that this movie is overrated. Overrated, indeed. I have never been a big fan of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.I admit, the first movie was visually stunning and used some novel techniques for example, to make characters appear much larger than others as actors moved with the cameras to sustain the illusions. It was really something different that came out at the time, especially considering the number of awful movies produced in the mainstream that year, Lord of the Rings really found a good following in a period of utter cinematic slump (at least among the mainstream and partly in the independent features). I think those idiots at the Academy Awards were dumb to pass up recognizing it for one of the top awards that year, probably best director if nothing else. As the first in the series, I think it was given the best treatment as far as writing, visuals, and editing (which would be the bain of the remaining two in the trilogy), and everything else. Again, it was a refreshing change in mainstream films that year, and certainly one well-deserving of the recognition.But the remaining two films, the Two Towers and now, Return of the King, were disappointing for one major reason: there was never enough in the movies (I don't know about the book) to sustain two movies at lengths of three hours or more each (not to mention the additional ""bonus"" footage feature on the DVDs). Someone here must've been so proud of their CGI creations and the time and money spent developing the sets that they must've felt like it was just bad manners to leave most of it on the cutting room floor. There is far too much repetition going on in the remaining too movies that could've easily have been made into one three hour film, rather than two.The Two Towers spent an ungodly amount of time with those epic battle scenes between the billions and billions of Uruk soldiers and the few good-willed soldiers lead by Aragon and others. I found myself aching for the movie to be over with, and was sadly disappointed considering my interest in the first one. We are left with a story of fleeting interest: Sam and Frodo on their journey to toss the ring in the fire (though the introduction of Gollum, that ugly little bugger, was quite an interesting part of the story), Aragon and his gang were out to battle the relentless Uruk army, and Merry and Pippin literally got to be tree hugging hobbits. If the filmmakers didn't worry so much about pleasing the audience with epic CGI battle scenes and concentrated on developing each separate story of the various characters in their journies, it probably would've been a much better film. Although, considering that the third movie, 'Return of the King,' contained a nauseating amount of repetition as far as the story, and dragging on time with endless amounts of boring, dreamy dialogue and even more endless battle scenes, I still think it should've been combined into one movie.
Not only endless dialogue of the fortune tellers and soothsayers, but also an ending that never seemed to end. Once again, it was like the filmmakers tried several things and liked every single ending and just stuck every single one in the movie, whether it was relevant or not (such as Sam and his hobbit daughters or the 'Wizard of Oz' ending where Elijah Wood puts on his queerest happy voice as he greets his friends 'round the bedside). The viewer who suggested that they should of ended it after the coronation was right, there was no need to drag on the movie for another half-hour of fade-ins and fade-outs of one happy ending after the next, as they did enough stalling throughout most of the movies, anyways.Return of the King is definitely overrated and was hardly deserving of the 'Best Picture' Oscar, nor for every other Oscar it snagged this year, leaving little to be anticipated during the awards knowing that the Lord of the Rings team would win whatever award was announced. The Academy was stupid for not recognizing it with top awards the first time around, and instead, waited for the third anti-climatic cult fest to finally give Jackson and his crew their dues. There were far better movies nominated for Best Picture and nearly every other award this year (save the special effects nominations).Once again, though, I do think that Peter Jackson and his crew did good with their efforts to recreate Tolkein's stories cinematically. That kind of undertaking for a trilogy filmed simultaneously over 18 months is quite incredible. I just though that, save for the Fellowhip of the Rings, the filmmakers failed to capitalize on the things that would've made the remaining two films in the trilogy something really great, especially if they weren't so bogged down in special effects and cheesy dialogue.

                The third installment of the Lord of the Rings was a good movie, however, I had many problems with the character development and acting in the movie. Sean Astin and Elijah Wood, (the only two exceptions,) played the roles of Frodo and Samwise admirably.  Even with some of the adaptations from Peter Jackson's interpretation of the books, the story is still intriguing. However, none of the other characters in the remaining part of the fellowship suffered no more than 3 seconds of any kind of acting at a time, as nearly all the dialogue from the book is erased.  And at the ending sequence, when Frodo wakes up, the cheerful scenes drag on forever, when Peter Jackson could have saved it by cutting off half the slow motion and instead, showing the last parts of the book with the burning & enslavement of the shire, and the uprising that followed.  All in all, it was a good movie.  Cinematic, epic, and, above all, bloody.

                Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King is no doubt the best movie I've seen. The film captures you instantly up to the words ""The End"" appearing on the screen. The Return of the King is nothing short of excitement.For all those who doesn't know what The Lord of the Rings is about (I'm thinking everybody does either through the books or the movies), here's a brief summary: Just over 50 year ago, J.R.R. Tolkien published a tale about a long, dangerous quest to destroy 1 ring. This tale is split into 3 novels, ""The Fellowship of the Rings"", ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"". This tale, is called ""The Lord of the Rings"". Nearly 50 years after the novels were published, Peter Jackson tells the tale in another way, by bringing it to life onto the big screen.This tale is about 9 people's quest to destroy one magic ring and return peace to Middle-Earth. If this one ring goes back to it's maker, the evil Sauron, the world will be under his control, bringing death and misery everywhere. The only way to destroy this powerful ring is to cast it into the fires of Mount Doom, where it was made. Only one hobbit could resist the temptation to keep the ring and this job was given to a hobbit named Frodo Baggins. To help him along the way, a fellowship of nine people were brought together. In it was a wizard, 2 men, an elf, a dwarf and three other hobbits. Together, they set out for Mordor, where Mount Doom is situated. Getting to Mordor is not as easy as it sounds. On the way they'll have to battle Orcs, Uruk-hais, giant spiders and other results of Tolkien's fascinating imagination.The Return of the King is the last addition to this vast trilogy. Peter Jackson does a great job in interpreting Tolkien's thoughts and feelings into a film. Watching the movies is just like reading the books themselves. If it was only the movies, it wouldn't have made such an impact on the public. The music in all three films practically takes you on your very own journey and the acting from the actors was also very impressive. If anything was missing from these movies, they just wouldn't have been such a success. Peter Jackson has done this to perfection.Overall, this is a must-watch movie. Plenty of action and special effects, not to mention a very heart warming ending to the trilogy. I'll just say one more thing, don't criticise anything until you have saw, heard or done it, especially Lord of the Rings.

                It's fantastic that someone finally succeeded in bring Tolkien to the big screen like this, and it took fantastic planning, and Jackson is deserving of every award he's received - and he should have received more.But there comes a time when CGI gets so close to but yet so far from reality that everything looks like a cartoon animated by van Gogh. I think these movies go too far without having much of a choice.The first part was enthralling because it was finally happening, and the Ringwraith were fantastic. The second part surprised by the emotion it invoked - it had all the flurry of a Lucas attempt at an epic but it had guts and grit too. And Jackson made his cast look earthy and human, and he introduced hormones into things that seem absent in the book(s).And it's a fantastic conclusion to be sure, but as with Titanic, the achievement is first and foremost that it happened and that it was a success. There is no way Jackson can get enough acclaim or recognition for what he has done.All I've got to say is I don't especially appreciate all these special effects. They come closer and closer to looking real but they will never be convincing. Serkis is amazing of course, and he should have received some sort of award. But there comes a time when the fantasy of the mind is better than trying to paint the impossible on screen.A lot of people will laud the movie because the effects were so good; this doesn't have squat to do with the quality of the movie. Like saying James Bond's Aston Martin is cool, therefore Connery/Lazenby/Moore/Dalton/Brosnan are good actors.No one can take away from Jackson what he did: a major achievement, a milestone in cinematic and cultural history. But I wasn't overly impressed, and in fact found myself looking at my watch wondering when it would all finally be over. Maybe I was satisfied the movie had made it and lost interest because I already knew the ending; maybe it was the plethora of CGI wizardry that had me longing for Wiley Coyote and his Roadrunner friend.At least there no one's trying to fool you into thinking it's real.

                This movie could really use an EE -- BADLY.  Characters are just picked up and discarded (Eomer, in particular), Eowyn's battle with the Witch King will, with luck, be expanded.  It was over before I knew it and the editing was shabby.  Too many oliphaunts and CGI, atrocious battle tactics on the part of the Rohirrim (sure, charge into a head of 10 story beasts even though we have bows and arrows and can shoot from a distance - sounds good!), meaningless inventions (Arwen's life tied to Ring, the Arwen ""to leave or not to leave"" flip flop, the Lembas Conspiracy, and that stupid Legolas-Oliphaunt trick), a limp confrontation scene with the king of the dead, no resolution to Saruman (the main bad guy of the first two films, if you've forgotten), and the worst hatchet job on an established fictional character (Denethor, Denethor, Denethor).  Horrible, horrible.  Plus a cheesy bed-jumping scene and coronation where the cheddar flowed in abundance.  It was a mess that I hope the EE will mend somewhat, but there's a lot to fix. A LOT.  A disappointing end to a trilogy that began with a masterpiece in FOTR.On the plus side, David Wenham, Billy Boyd and Sean Astin.  They were brilliant and made it worth spending the money to see it once.  Their performances were true and heartfelt, though Faramir sadly dropped out of the picture because PJ unwisely cut the Houses of Healing sequence.It's not worth the hype and I didn't think this once in a lifetime film event would end so sadly.

                To keep rating simple for my vote, let's just say that I'll give this film 9/10, but don't ask me what I'd say for what's lacking, for I wouldn't know what to say. It's a generously long film, no commercial breaks, if a person wants to call those interruptions breaks anyway, and I definitely am not qualified to criticize this film in any respect. Still, I'll give 9/10 rather than 10/10, to be conservative, say. :)People should, however, learn the basics of the story before seeing this film in order to get the most satisfaction from it. I read Tolkien's story in book form and later saw the three-part film for LOTR. So, seeing this film directed by Peter Jackson, I had no pre-study to do. One thing viewers need to know is the importance of the ring. I guess that it is the most elementary part of the story. Otherwise, people can naturally wonder what the fuss is about a ring even if it appears to be made of gold. If it's supposed to be gold, then that's not what's important about it. What is, is the magical or mystical power that it provides to whoever is wearing it and that this power is related, say, to evil. This becomes obvious in this film, but only far into it.Great film though.

                I think those that have described both this movie and the trilogy as the 'greatest ever' should go back to their video games.  In time, all three of these movies will take their rightful place in film history...oblivion. 
I can't understand how people can equate special effects with great film making.  There's really nothing positive that I can say about these movies except that the special effects were at first stunning.  Soon their repetitiveness led to utter boredom.I would much rather watch a film about realistic situations that people can actually relate to.  But I guess if you spent your entire life playing video games and watching other special effects based movies like these, then these movies would qualify as the greatest ever.Someone made the comment that this movie was better than Citizen Kane. Watch this movie as many times as Citizen Kane and see which holds up better.  Believe me, this whole trilogy will be a fading memory in ten or twenty years and Citizen Kane will continue to be praised.  This is just another case of the 'dumbing down' of the culture.  These same people probably can't wait until the next Superbowl so they can watch the commercials.I generously gave all three movies of this trilogy a 5/10.

                I went to see ROTK for the 2nd time yesterday and aside from the myriad of minor flaws, want to concentrate on major issues surrounding Jackson's character development.ARAGORN is the first big problem. In the book he is both a ranger from the north, but also a man destined to be king. He knows who he is, and he has an expectation of that destiny. Likewise in the book he has 'spiritual' awareness. Aragorn is descended, not merely from men, but from Numenor: so he already has in him some of the blood of the Elves. Now Jackson gives all foresight to the Elves - making the men merely, men. But the whole point is that the-man-born-to-be-king has the spiritual awareness of the great kings of old. Thus, in book II at the river it is Aragorn, not Legolas (as in Jackson's version), who is aware of a shadow growing in his heart. And, more significantly, it is Aragorn who in the book takes the palantir by his right (Gandalf actually bows to give it to him). Gandalf counsels him not to use it, but Aragorn knows who he is. So he looks in the palantir and shows Sauron the sword. He challenges Sauron, and then wrenches the palantir away from the Eye to use as HE wills, not as Sauron wills. In so doing he sees the black fleet, and so knows the threat. That's why he takes the path of the dead. And when he goes under the Dimholt he REALLY summons the dead. The exchange in the film between Aragorn and the Geoffrey-Rush-Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-look-alike ghost is feeble in the film. In the book Aragorn does not doubt who he is: he calls them, not barters with them.Now Aragorn's action here is part of a much larger cohesion in Tolkien that is entirely absent in Jackson. As a result we're left with a desperately anti-climactic coronation. Why? There's simply been no character development of Aragorn. He's been denuded of a sense of who he is.SAURON is the next big problem. It's true that in the book he is mostly referred to as the Eye. But he also has personality. In the film, apart from the opening sequence to film I (which was brilliant) all we have is a plasma lamp sometime searchlight. Since in the book Gandalf has told Frodo that 'Sauron is taking shape again' why on earth didn't Jackson then develop Sauron from the figure in film I? In the book, we are told of Sauron's gnawing doubt. We hear of reports about 'spies' entering Mordor. We know that he is consumed by fear of the upstart heir of Elendil. None of this is developed in the film. (And the Ring seems to lose power on entering Mordor, not gain it!) Result? There was no sense of elation at the fall of Barad'dur.Now this is a serious theological error that I suspect Tolkien would have detested. Personify good, and you must also personify evil. Tolkien's epic was all about those forces being personified: and how you discern them. Sauron is a personification of evil. He's not actually the worst - that belongs to Morgoth (of whom the Balrog is a servant). Whilst Tolkien rightly loathed allegory, he nonetheless never would have countenanced such a weak and ineffectual portrayal of the enemy. The whole point, and if this isn't obvious in the world today then Jackson is even less astute than I imagined, is that evil in many guises takes human form.OTHERSThe same lack of characterisation in Aragorn and Sauron goes on with many of the others. Notable exceptions are GANDALF and SARUMAN (both well acted). Jackson made a mistake in cutting Saruman out of III having made so much of him in I and II (more than the book). ARWEN is drippy throughout. EOWYN is changed in the film. Miranda Otto was excellent. But Jackson plays up the love between her and Aragorn so much that we are left wondering how Eowyn is apparently beatifically happy to see him with Arwen. On the subject of Eowyn it's such a shame Jackson didn't do the slaying of the witch-king better. In the book the battlefield pauses - a cloud goes up and everyone in Minas Tirith is happy. It's one of the truly great moments, lost by Jackson. The reports even leak back to the orcs in the tower above Shelob's lair so that Sam and Frodo hear that 'No.1. has been done in'.As for the HOBBITS . I think this may be a question of preference. Personally I think Sean Astin's acting as SAM is execrable, but some like it. For me, the simple gardener becomes a mini-philosopher and I find his soliloquy both at the end of film II in Osgiliath (to which they never go in the book) and on the mountain (twice) truly toe-curlingly dreadful: pap I'm afraid. And, oh dear, we even veered towards Titanic-music-moments at the end of film I and again on the mountain. BILBO was fine until the end. Yes, we know he ages fast now he's lost the ring, but the Salieri-style prosthetics are poor. Jackson loves the slow-motion work so much that we have to endure some particularly dreadful sequences with the Hobbits (most notably the already infamous bed scene) and at the end (where I really thought Frodo was going to give Sam a full-on smacker!). A similarly tacky piece of directing occurs when the elves appear - the soft focus lens is deployed with 'celtic' singing. Argh -  this is kindergarten film production.I expect the film will garner the Oscars ceremony. But I hope some people in Tinsel town have the courage to acknowledge that whilst some of the visuals are outstanding (though many are not - e.g. the oliphaunt descent by Legolas, the Merrick-style leader of the orcs, and the Army of the dead), the film is not actually very good.Peter - I'm afraid you've let us, and J.R.R. Tolkien, down.

                The perfect end to a magnificent trilogy, Return of the King is one of the best fantasy films ever made. The story concludes with poignant payoffs set up in the first two installments. Each character has their moment to shine and there is true growth in each of their narratives.The setting is gorgeous (I want to live at Minas Tirith), the score is profound (especially in the third act) and the story is well balanced. The script is incredibly well written and the slick dialogue is performed masterfully. From ""I am no man"" to ""For Frodo!"" to ""My lady!"" and many more, there are chill-inducing moments due to smart writing.While it is emotionally draining to complete the trilogy, it is equally fulfilling. There is a lot packed into these 10 hours of film (non-extended editions). Though long and complicated, Return of the King wraps up the best trilogy ever made with elegance.Best Character: Samwise Gamgee (Top 5 most selfless character in all of cinema)
Best Moment: The ""My friends, you bow to no one"" scene
Best Quote: ""I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you!"" - Sam.

                The Return of the King is the renowned final chapter in Peter Jackson's legendary Lord of The Rings film trilogy. The films in this trilogy are widely considered to be some of the greatest fantasy films ever made.It is a testament to the quality of Return of the King that it is without a doubt the best film in the trilogy. The story, characters, world building, and cinematography all combine to create one of the most magnificent franchise finales of all time.The Return of the King boasts an emotionally powerful and moving story of how sheer perseverance, love, loyalty, and friendship are more important qualities than mere physical strength. It also brilliantly showcases how even the smallest person can accomplish great feats of heroism and courage. These were always the core themes of Lord of the Rings and this film makes sure they take center stage in the narrative.The story is also brilliantly grounded in human emotion which makes for a very emotionally stirring watch. Many of the most powerful scenes in the film are after the great battles have died down and the characters share intimate, bittersweet, and touching moments with each other. Some of these moments are enough to bring tears from nearly anyone's eyes.This timeless story is elevated by what can only be described as a near flawless cast. The amount of acting talent on display here is astounding with greats like Sir lan Mckellen, Viggo Mortensen, Andy Serkis, Karl Urban, and Orlando Bloom all giving memorable acting performances in an enormous ensemble cast. The performances of this top notch cast perfectly bring the characters to life and help to immerse the audience into the film's captivating world.The Return of the King's spectacular visuals are some of the finest in the history of blockbuster filmmaking. The larger than life cinematography vividly conveys the unimaginable vastness of Middle Earth. Grand sweeping shots of mountain ranges, nearly endless fields, volcanoes, gigantic ancient cities, and other arresting vistas are shown with stunning detail. The way Jackson effortlessly blends CGI locales with real places in these shots is astonishing and something I have not seen done nearly as well in any other movie outside of the other Lord of the Rings films.On the subject of CGI, the special effects work for this film is truly state of the art. The impossibly realistic motion capture on Gollum's face, along with the marvellously sinister monster and creature designs are both impressive to behold.This great special effects work and the audacious cinematography both work in perfect union during any of The Return of the King's jaw dropping battle sequences. The battles in this film simply must be seen to be believed. I do not speak lightly when I say that Return of The King has some of the most epic, breathtaking, and blood pumping battle scenes in movie history. Peter Jackson's excellent direction and the overwhelming visual spectacle of these scenes are enough to make them endlessly exciting on every re-watch.These unbelievable action sequences are enhanced further by a chilling and awe inspiring musical score by composer Howard Shore. This phenomenal soundtrack also permeates the film's more quiet character moments too where it is serene and beautiful to listen to. It works wonders to elevate these scenes as wellOverall, The Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King is one of the purest examples of an emotional rollercoaster you will find in American Cinema. It can make you cry, cheer, and smile like almost no other film. It is a timeless grand epic and a true landmark in the fantasy film genre.

                Just wow!This movie is just mind-blowing in every aspect-the climax, the battles, the cinematography and effects, everything! I don't usually cry watching movies anymore, but man, this one shook me. All the characters you've come to grow and love are finally pitted together for one last glorious finale, and it couldn't have been better.The lore and story of this series is so richly detailed and magical yet fits perfectly in the trilogy, and The Return of the King is easily the greatest adaption of the three. The odds are finally stacked here in the endgame and who dies does die for good.This movie is easily in my top three favorites of all time and stands as an ultimate epic of one of the greatest stories of good vs evil of all time!

                Well, I think I said in my review of TTT that I was afraid that Jackson and company wouldn't be able to fit in all that was left. Now, though I have not seen the extended cut (longer than the cut of _Napoleon_, I believe!), it looks like they added much of it back there.As a Tolkien geek of 30+ years I was greatly impressed by these films even though I miss much of the subtlety of the book itself. However, that subtlety is not entirely lost; instead, it is often taken up in the acting. Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto actually make *more* of their characters than the books do. All of the Hobbits are fine, Andy Serkis is better than fine, and Ian Holm, bless him, gives all the young ones lessons in sly scene stealing. Ian McKellen is a bit too subdued at times, but when he hits the mark he's very powerful. Elves are basically impossible to play, but all of the actors in those roles do well even if Orlando Bloom is a bit callow.The revelation throughout all three films, though, is Viggo Mortensen. I hated him immediately upon his entrance in the first film, then quickly started to reassess as the film moved on. I quickly realized that he managed to hit every single one of even the deepest notes of the character, a man who is not only skilled beyond his first appearance but whose nature as a hero and a king is based in millennia of history and inheritance. It is an amazing performance, one of the best I have ever seen, and so strong that even though the end of the film was naturally without him I missed his character, just as I do every time I read the book.So, enjoy the CGI. But watch the acting - that's where you'll get the depth of the tale.

                Antipodean director Peter Jackson here proves beyond doubt that he's picked up Spielberg's mantle as the director most competent at blending dazzling special effects with convincing emotional drama. The third part of Jackson's opus sees the One Ring return to Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit, while the hordes of Gorgoroth sweep into the realm of man in their tens of thousands. Bad Taste this ain't.This is the boldest of the three movies in that it necessarily must take the most risks in depicting Tolkien's universe. It's a delicate balancing act. For instance, some will love the Jackson of old re-emerging for the Paths of the Dead sequence, while others will resent its Temple of Doom comedy-horror stylings. Legolas skipping up the leg of an olyphaunt and then sliding down its trunk as it falls: fanboys loathe that stuff; the kids love it. But thankfully, due to Return of the King's structure - a series of action scenes built around Gandalf's (Ian McKellen) dreadful narration - one doesn't have to wait long until the next set-piece arrives. And we're spoiled for choice. Gandalf, for example, doesn't only narrate - he also, exhilaratingly, sweeps onto the plain of Pelennor to ward off the Nazgul with a blinding shaft of light. Shelob doesn't disappoint; Weta have created a memorable monster who tickles the neck-hairs of Tolkien devotees and unsuspecting arachnophobics alike (I had not yet read the novel at this point...). And the lighting of the beacons, erupting from far snow-capped peaks, calling to Gondor under the bellowing strains of Howard Shore's aptly triumphant score, might be the single most rousing sequence in movie history. It's the ignition of hope, a glimmer of unbridled joy before the darkness descends.The biggest omission from the novel is the Scouring of the Shire. I happen to agree with the screenwriters' decision. By that time, we've already had two or three endings. We've been stuffed with a veritable feast in the form of the Battle of Pelennor and the Fall of Sauron; the Scouring, I believe, would have been an unwanted dessert. Besides, Tolkien's epilogue was something of a matter of celebrity. Aragorn's final words to the hobbits, as all of Middle Earth kneels, says more about the height of their standing than any Shire-war would.Some minor flaws still remain. Legolas and Gimli's character arcs still reach no real resolution (but then, do we really need another two endings?). The position of the Battle of Pelennor in the story's narrative doesn't really lend itself to the classical Hollywood narrative very comfortably - there's a predictable, albeit only slight, feeling of 'winding down' in all that follows. Also, on this extended DVD, the point at which we are asked to change discs comes at a most inopportune time, as the drums of war are at their peak.But it seems strangely impertinent to sniff out the trilogy's few flaws; to do so is like picking at the hem of the Bayeux Tapestry. Will we ever see such a wholly satisfying series of films again? Not in my lifetime. (N.B. The score is for all three.) This is pure cinema. Jackson and his creative family just don't stop giving. He has successfully translated his love for his source material and created a body of work that will live on and become equally loved. The scope of his achievement is undeniable; as entertainment, this is about as close to perfection as cinema will get.

                So, this is the end and what an anti-climax it is. The Two Towers showed some promise, although half of it bored my pants off.Here again only half the movie is interesting.  The Frodo and Sam part is so boring and repetitive I just needed to use my Fast Forward button to get through it.  This is what happens in this part: Sam screams at Gollum, Frodo defends Gollum, Gollum speaks to himself, Frodo is in mortal danger and Sam saves him.  They've been doing the very same thing over and over again since the beginning of The Two Towers.Then the other part: also a replay of The Two Towers, I'm afraid.  Orcs attack a human stronghold and the humans barely survive.  The battle is even the same: everything is almost lost and then re-enforcements arrive saving the day. It's also quite obvious that Viggo Mortenssen was a very bad choice for a pivotal part in this movie.  His acting is wooden and his courageous speech before the battle is so powerless, mainly because of his wimpy voice and his foreign accent doesn't help either.The ending starts about half an hour before the credits and just keeps going on and on. Aragon is crowned king and that should have been it.  But no, they need to sugar coat everyone's exit till it almost made me throw up.Ok, the source material does dictate how it ends (although the ending of the book was better), but it could've been made better by just ending after the coronation.So 3 out 3 movies that were only half interesting.  So, maybe time for a new cut with only the interesting parts (about three hours for the whole lot would do).

                (2003) The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King FANTASY/ ACTION(Contains spoiler warnings) After seeing the first two ""Lord of the Ring"" films, I have to say that the longer version should've been the one to be shown to audiences since upon watching this shorter version, I was baffled about the status of Sauroman and Snake which was never elaborated at all on this short version! There was also a longer interaction scene on other scenes as well and would help the status regarding some of it's other characters not adressed on the shorter version but is elaboritated more on the longer version especially on Eowyn which upon seeing the shorter version was completely cut off and felt was necessary to be shown here since she was the one who finished the main guy! The shorter version just showed Eowyn hand in hand with the injured guy without the audience wondering how their relationship came about! And although, the battle scenes seemed to be intact in the third, what's interesting about all three ""Lord of the Ring"" films are that at the end of each film consist of different styles of battle, whereas on the first one, it was alot of one on one combat without the use of any CGI. On ""The Two Towers"", the second battle had the use of CGI but the battle was very full forced, while the orcs were standing ground. Finally, in ""The Return of the King"" somewhat of a final battle included oliphants which the good and bad guys all were fighting was very sporadic or all over the place! SHORTER VERSION gets 90% about 3.5 since some things should've been addressed but still effective, nonetheless! LONGER VERSION gets 4 out of 4 for it's completion. Winner of 11 Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director for Peter Jackson.

                I've just seen this on the big screen for the first time since I saw it at London's sadly now long-gone Odeon at Marble Arch, which - at the time - boasted the biggest screen in the UK, and it has lost little of it's magic. Continuing with the interwoven tales of ""Frodo"", ""Sam"" and their treacherous guide ""Gollum"" as they trek through fire and brimstone to get the ring to Mount Doom; whilst Gandalf, Aragorn and the surviving members of the fellowship try to stem the might of ""Sauron"" and his armies of orcs and their allies. While this is undoubtedly a magnificent piece of cinema, I find the story drags a bit. I found the the focus to be too much on the less interesting characters - the lovelorn ""Eowyn"" (Miranda Otto); the delusional ""Denethor"" (John Noble) and decent but rather wimpish ""Faramir"" (David Wenham) as ""Gondor"" faces the wrath of their nemesis, and that slows the pace from the action just when it ought to be building. The delightful, friendly, rivalry between ""Gimli"" & ""Legolas"" features all too sparingly and it's got too ponderous a narrative to sustain the four hours the otherwise visionary Peter Jackson has created. Fortunately, the triple-header quest with Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and a superb Andy Serkis keep the other strand moving along suspensefully and tensely. The battle scenes are superb, though - when we get them, the effects really do rise to the occasion and, of course, the striking cinematography coupled with the inspired themes from Howard Shore contribute to a thoroughly entertaining adaptation of a thoroughly captivating fantasy adventure. If you make it past the start of the credits, there is the gloriously haunting ""Into the West"" from Annie Lennox to top off this finest of trilogies. The Oscar/BAFTA awards this achieved are a just reward for years of stunningly creative effort from thousands of people who turned the imagination of a 20th Century English academic into films that will last forever.

                I loved it! No doubt about it, spectaculair effects, battles etc. But, and there's a big but, the movie doesn't add anything new to the trilogy. In the first part we could marvel at the wonderfull world of Tolkien that Peter Jackson so brilliantly captured on the big screen. In part two, there was action, battles and magnificent special effects.But what does part 3 have? More of the same. It had to be made, to complete the story and Peter Jackson did a great job. But especially the last hour was almost boring. After the twentieth happy-ending-swelling-music-scene, I was almost begging for the end. Still, I loved it, but maybe that was more because of the first two movies, or because of the book.....

                I loved the first two LOTR films, and was keyed up almost beyond endurance to see ROTK the first week it opened. When the film was over, I was stunned by the depth of disappointment I was feeling. In fact, I went back and watched the movie again a few days later; I could not believe that it really had been as bad as I'd experienced. The fault must have been mine, I thought; I'd been too wound up to really take it in. With a cooler head, I'd be able to enjoy it and the magic would work again, as it had with the previous two movies. Alas, no. The movie was just as bad as I'd thought, and it somehow managed to posthumously poison my pleasure in the other two movies as well. I've never been able to enjoy any of them since.I came to really hate Peter Jackson, especially after watching all the ""making of"" interviews on the dvds. I believe he is an undisciplined, self-indulgent egomaniac, and these characteristics progressively took over as the film series continued. Fellowship of the Ring was the best of the lot, and I feel it's because it was a gamble. Now that the series is over, people forget that before FOTR premiered, there was no guarantee that the film would be a success. LOTR was a notoriously difficult book to adapt, and many worried that it couldn't be done. In that atmosphere, Jackson and his co-writers were at their most deferential to the original Tolkien text, and almost humble in their approach to such a daunting task.After FOTR was a big success, they became more confident in their own skills, and felt bold enough to try a little rewriting for The Two Towers, even while assuring fans that it was only a little strategic reorganizing, and the original story would be preserved in ROTK. By that point, however, Jackson was so deluded by the sycophantic flattery that surrounded him on all sides, he was convinced that the fans would adoringly accept anything he filmed, simply because it was the product of such a genius. ROTK could not contain both Tolkien's story and Jackson's ego, and guess which won in the end? The story flopped all over the place, with Saruman's storyline simply chopped off and left unresolved, while Jackson wasted time indulging in invented scenes back in Rohan, when the story should have moved decisively to Gondor. That, however, was not the part of the story that interested him, so we had to have more loving photography of carved dark wood beams and animal-skin rugs, plus a vastly overdrawn love connection between Eowyn and Aragorn. When Jackson finally had to tear himself away from this romantic Viking paradise and turn to Gondor, he revenged himself on the story by turning Gondor into a sterile, dead cement city, full of cowards and idiots.Worst of all, I felt that by ROTK Jackson was even getting sloppy on what had been a trademark of the films until then - set design and scale. For a scene where Gandalf and Pippin are on a balcony, looking towards Minas Morgul, he had both actors on the same set, with Pippin merely kneeling at the balcony, while Gandalf towered over him. However, the brain can quite clearly calculate that the scale of the balcony in relation to the bodies of both characters is wrong - in FOTR, Jackson would have built a larger-scale model of the balcony for Pippin, to keep up the illusion that he was a smaller figure in a setting made for people of Gandalf's size. This time, he couldn't be bothered, as if he felt that he'd paid his dues being accurate in the first two movies, and now he should be free to play around and have fun.That was amply demonstrated with the stupid green goblins, the endless battle scenes, the noise, the shaking camera, and the labored ""humour"" in every Gimli scene. What annoyed me the most, however, was that Jackson seemed to have no grasp of what Tolkien thought was important. In the movie, only the ""stars"" are able to act (and yes, that includes the Hobbits), whereas Tolkien showed that nobility, courage and heroism are EVERYONE's business. In the books, the individual soldiers of Gondor had personalities, felt connected to the greater cause, and debated how best they could do their duty. In Jackson's movies, Aragorn and Gandalf do all the fighting, while crowds of women blubber helplessly and soldiers blunder about uselessly. This is why his removal of the Scouring of the Shire was both execrable and inevitable. Jackson can't recognize any drama in ordinary people in ordinary settings facing crisis and either failing or rising to the occasion - to him, the Shire is just dumb peasants who were too stupid not to leave home for adventure, and there's nothing more to be expected of them. Tolkien's whole theme was that adventure and crisis are NOT the sole property of noble heroes, but that it can touch anyone, and how we react when it does is as important as Aragorn's struggle with Sauron or Denethor's descent into madness.

                I loved the first two movies. In fact, I liked Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers so much I watched them five times.Unfortunately, The Return of the King seemed a rather big overkill for me - it seemed too rushed - poorly edited - an overindulgent overkill.The scenes were all pretty epic in the book - but Jackson juiced it up too much.I didn't like the charge of the Riders of Rohan - it just looked so... fake for some reason.The scene when the Eye of Sauron topples over - was so laughable.I really wanted to like it but I just couldn't. I'm sorry.And to top it off - we get Annie Lennox singing that song at the end - I like Lennox - but I just found her version of this song lackluster. Goodness knows why ROTK scooped up all the Academy Awards. They should have given it all to FOTR instead.

"201"," The biggest problem of all is lack of character development ...

                I went to see ROTK for the 2nd time yesterday and aside from the myriad of minor flaws, want to concentrate on major issues surrounding Jackson's character development.ARAGORN is the first big problem. In the book he is both a ranger from the north, but also a man destined to be king. He knows who he is, and he has an expectation of that destiny. Likewise in the book he has 'spiritual' awareness. Aragorn is descended, not merely from men, but from Numenor: so he already has in him some of the blood of the Elves. Now Jackson gives all foresight to the Elves - making the men merely, men. But the whole point is that the-man-born-to-be-king has the spiritual awareness of the great kings of old. Thus, in book II at the river it is Aragorn, not Legolas (as in Jackson's version), who is aware of a shadow growing in his heart. And, more significantly, it is Aragorn who in the book takes the palantir by his right (Gandalf actually bows to give it to him). Gandalf counsels him not to use it, but Aragorn knows who he is. So he looks in the palantir and shows Sauron the sword. He challenges Sauron, and then wrenches the palantir away from the Eye to use as HE wills, not as Sauron wills. In so doing he sees the black fleet, and so knows the threat. That's why he takes the path of the dead. And when he goes under the Dimholt he REALLY summons the dead. The exchange in the film between Aragorn and the Geoffrey-Rush-Pirates-of-the-Caribbean-look-alike ghost is feeble in the film. In the book Aragorn does not doubt who he is: he calls them, not barters with them.Now Aragorn's action here is part of a much larger cohesion in Tolkien that is entirely absent in Jackson. As a result we're left with a desperately anti-climactic coronation. Why? There's simply been no character development of Aragorn. He's been denuded of a sense of who he is.SAURON is the next big problem. It's true that in the book he is mostly referred to as the Eye. But he also has personality. In the film, apart from the opening sequence to film I (which was brilliant) all we have is a plasma lamp sometime searchlight. Since in the book Gandalf has told Frodo that 'Sauron is taking shape again' why on earth didn't Jackson then develop Sauron from the figure in film I? In the book, we are told of Sauron's gnawing doubt. We hear of reports about 'spies' entering Mordor. We know that he is consumed by fear of the upstart heir of Elendil. None of this is developed in the film. (And the Ring seems to lose power on entering Mordor, not gain it!) Result? There was no sense of elation at the fall of Barad'dur.Now this is a serious theological error that I suspect Tolkien would have detested. Personify good, and you must also personify evil. Tolkien's epic was all about those forces being personified: and how you discern them. Sauron is a personification of evil. He's not actually the worst - that belongs to Morgoth (of whom the Balrog is a servant). Whilst Tolkien rightly loathed allegory, he nonetheless never would have countenanced such a weak and ineffectual portrayal of the enemy. The whole point, and if this isn't obvious in the world today then Jackson is even less astute than I imagined, is that evil in many guises takes human form.OTHERSThe same lack of characterisation in Aragorn and Sauron goes on with many of the others. Notable exceptions are GANDALF and SARUMAN (both well acted). Jackson made a mistake in cutting Saruman out of III having made so much of him in I and II (more than the book). ARWEN is drippy throughout. EOWYN is changed in the film. Miranda Otto was excellent. But Jackson plays up the love between her and Aragorn so much that we are left wondering how Eowyn is apparently beatifically happy to see him with Arwen. On the subject of Eowyn it's such a shame Jackson didn't do the slaying of the witch-king better. In the book the battlefield pauses - a cloud goes up and everyone in Minas Tirith is happy. It's one of the truly great moments, lost by Jackson. The reports even leak back to the orcs in the tower above Shelob's lair so that Sam and Frodo hear that 'No.1. has been done in'.As for the HOBBITS . I think this may be a question of preference. Personally I think Sean Astin's acting as SAM is execrable, but some like it. For me, the simple gardener becomes a mini-philosopher and I find his soliloquy both at the end of film II in Osgiliath (to which they never go in the book) and on the mountain (twice) truly toe-curlingly dreadful: pap I'm afraid. And, oh dear, we even veered towards Titanic-music-moments at the end of film I and again on the mountain. BILBO was fine until the end. Yes, we know he ages fast now he's lost the ring, but the Salieri-style prosthetics are poor. Jackson loves the slow-motion work so much that we have to endure some particularly dreadful sequences with the Hobbits (most notably the already infamous bed scene) and at the end (where I really thought Frodo was going to give Sam a full-on smacker!). A similarly tacky piece of directing occurs when the elves appear - the soft focus lens is deployed with 'celtic' singing. Argh -  this is kindergarten film production.I expect the film will garner the Oscars ceremony. But I hope some people in Tinsel town have the courage to acknowledge that whilst some of the visuals are outstanding (though many are not - e.g. the oliphaunt descent by Legolas, the Merrick-style leader of the orcs, and the Army of the dead), the film is not actually very good.Peter - I'm afraid you've let us, and J.R.R. Tolkien, down.

                The perfect end to a magnificent trilogy, Return of the King is one of the best fantasy films ever made. The story concludes with poignant payoffs set up in the first two installments. Each character has their moment to shine and there is true growth in each of their narratives.The setting is gorgeous (I want to live at Minas Tirith), the score is profound (especially in the third act) and the story is well balanced. The script is incredibly well written and the slick dialogue is performed masterfully. From ""I am no man"" to ""For Frodo!"" to ""My lady!"" and many more, there are chill-inducing moments due to smart writing.While it is emotionally draining to complete the trilogy, it is equally fulfilling. There is a lot packed into these 10 hours of film (non-extended editions). Though long and complicated, Return of the King wraps up the best trilogy ever made with elegance.Best Character: Samwise Gamgee (Top 5 most selfless character in all of cinema)
Best Moment: The ""My friends, you bow to no one"" scene
Best Quote: ""I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you!"" - Sam.

                The Return of the King is the renowned final chapter in Peter Jackson's legendary Lord of The Rings film trilogy. The films in this trilogy are widely considered to be some of the greatest fantasy films ever made.It is a testament to the quality of Return of the King that it is without a doubt the best film in the trilogy. The story, characters, world building, and cinematography all combine to create one of the most magnificent franchise finales of all time.The Return of the King boasts an emotionally powerful and moving story of how sheer perseverance, love, loyalty, and friendship are more important qualities than mere physical strength. It also brilliantly showcases how even the smallest person can accomplish great feats of heroism and courage. These were always the core themes of Lord of the Rings and this film makes sure they take center stage in the narrative.The story is also brilliantly grounded in human emotion which makes for a very emotionally stirring watch. Many of the most powerful scenes in the film are after the great battles have died down and the characters share intimate, bittersweet, and touching moments with each other. Some of these moments are enough to bring tears from nearly anyone's eyes.This timeless story is elevated by what can only be described as a near flawless cast. The amount of acting talent on display here is astounding with greats like Sir lan Mckellen, Viggo Mortensen, Andy Serkis, Karl Urban, and Orlando Bloom all giving memorable acting performances in an enormous ensemble cast. The performances of this top notch cast perfectly bring the characters to life and help to immerse the audience into the film's captivating world.The Return of the King's spectacular visuals are some of the finest in the history of blockbuster filmmaking. The larger than life cinematography vividly conveys the unimaginable vastness of Middle Earth. Grand sweeping shots of mountain ranges, nearly endless fields, volcanoes, gigantic ancient cities, and other arresting vistas are shown with stunning detail. The way Jackson effortlessly blends CGI locales with real places in these shots is astonishing and something I have not seen done nearly as well in any other movie outside of the other Lord of the Rings films.On the subject of CGI, the special effects work for this film is truly state of the art. The impossibly realistic motion capture on Gollum's face, along with the marvellously sinister monster and creature designs are both impressive to behold.This great special effects work and the audacious cinematography both work in perfect union during any of The Return of the King's jaw dropping battle sequences. The battles in this film simply must be seen to be believed. I do not speak lightly when I say that Return of The King has some of the most epic, breathtaking, and blood pumping battle scenes in movie history. Peter Jackson's excellent direction and the overwhelming visual spectacle of these scenes are enough to make them endlessly exciting on every re-watch.These unbelievable action sequences are enhanced further by a chilling and awe inspiring musical score by composer Howard Shore. This phenomenal soundtrack also permeates the film's more quiet character moments too where it is serene and beautiful to listen to. It works wonders to elevate these scenes as wellOverall, The Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King is one of the purest examples of an emotional rollercoaster you will find in American Cinema. It can make you cry, cheer, and smile like almost no other film. It is a timeless grand epic and a true landmark in the fantasy film genre.

                Just wow!This movie is just mind-blowing in every aspect-the climax, the battles, the cinematography and effects, everything! I don't usually cry watching movies anymore, but man, this one shook me. All the characters you've come to grow and love are finally pitted together for one last glorious finale, and it couldn't have been better.The lore and story of this series is so richly detailed and magical yet fits perfectly in the trilogy, and The Return of the King is easily the greatest adaption of the three. The odds are finally stacked here in the endgame and who dies does die for good.This movie is easily in my top three favorites of all time and stands as an ultimate epic of one of the greatest stories of good vs evil of all time!

                Well, I think I said in my review of TTT that I was afraid that Jackson and company wouldn't be able to fit in all that was left. Now, though I have not seen the extended cut (longer than the cut of _Napoleon_, I believe!), it looks like they added much of it back there.As a Tolkien geek of 30+ years I was greatly impressed by these films even though I miss much of the subtlety of the book itself. However, that subtlety is not entirely lost; instead, it is often taken up in the acting. Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto actually make *more* of their characters than the books do. All of the Hobbits are fine, Andy Serkis is better than fine, and Ian Holm, bless him, gives all the young ones lessons in sly scene stealing. Ian McKellen is a bit too subdued at times, but when he hits the mark he's very powerful. Elves are basically impossible to play, but all of the actors in those roles do well even if Orlando Bloom is a bit callow.The revelation throughout all three films, though, is Viggo Mortensen. I hated him immediately upon his entrance in the first film, then quickly started to reassess as the film moved on. I quickly realized that he managed to hit every single one of even the deepest notes of the character, a man who is not only skilled beyond his first appearance but whose nature as a hero and a king is based in millennia of history and inheritance. It is an amazing performance, one of the best I have ever seen, and so strong that even though the end of the film was naturally without him I missed his character, just as I do every time I read the book.So, enjoy the CGI. But watch the acting - that's where you'll get the depth of the tale.

                Antipodean director Peter Jackson here proves beyond doubt that he's picked up Spielberg's mantle as the director most competent at blending dazzling special effects with convincing emotional drama. The third part of Jackson's opus sees the One Ring return to Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit, while the hordes of Gorgoroth sweep into the realm of man in their tens of thousands. Bad Taste this ain't.This is the boldest of the three movies in that it necessarily must take the most risks in depicting Tolkien's universe. It's a delicate balancing act. For instance, some will love the Jackson of old re-emerging for the Paths of the Dead sequence, while others will resent its Temple of Doom comedy-horror stylings. Legolas skipping up the leg of an olyphaunt and then sliding down its trunk as it falls: fanboys loathe that stuff; the kids love it. But thankfully, due to Return of the King's structure - a series of action scenes built around Gandalf's (Ian McKellen) dreadful narration - one doesn't have to wait long until the next set-piece arrives. And we're spoiled for choice. Gandalf, for example, doesn't only narrate - he also, exhilaratingly, sweeps onto the plain of Pelennor to ward off the Nazgul with a blinding shaft of light. Shelob doesn't disappoint; Weta have created a memorable monster who tickles the neck-hairs of Tolkien devotees and unsuspecting arachnophobics alike (I had not yet read the novel at this point...). And the lighting of the beacons, erupting from far snow-capped peaks, calling to Gondor under the bellowing strains of Howard Shore's aptly triumphant score, might be the single most rousing sequence in movie history. It's the ignition of hope, a glimmer of unbridled joy before the darkness descends.The biggest omission from the novel is the Scouring of the Shire. I happen to agree with the screenwriters' decision. By that time, we've already had two or three endings. We've been stuffed with a veritable feast in the form of the Battle of Pelennor and the Fall of Sauron; the Scouring, I believe, would have been an unwanted dessert. Besides, Tolkien's epilogue was something of a matter of celebrity. Aragorn's final words to the hobbits, as all of Middle Earth kneels, says more about the height of their standing than any Shire-war would.Some minor flaws still remain. Legolas and Gimli's character arcs still reach no real resolution (but then, do we really need another two endings?). The position of the Battle of Pelennor in the story's narrative doesn't really lend itself to the classical Hollywood narrative very comfortably - there's a predictable, albeit only slight, feeling of 'winding down' in all that follows. Also, on this extended DVD, the point at which we are asked to change discs comes at a most inopportune time, as the drums of war are at their peak.But it seems strangely impertinent to sniff out the trilogy's few flaws; to do so is like picking at the hem of the Bayeux Tapestry. Will we ever see such a wholly satisfying series of films again? Not in my lifetime. (N.B. The score is for all three.) This is pure cinema. Jackson and his creative family just don't stop giving. He has successfully translated his love for his source material and created a body of work that will live on and become equally loved. The scope of his achievement is undeniable; as entertainment, this is about as close to perfection as cinema will get.

                So, this is the end and what an anti-climax it is. The Two Towers showed some promise, although half of it bored my pants off.Here again only half the movie is interesting.  The Frodo and Sam part is so boring and repetitive I just needed to use my Fast Forward button to get through it.  This is what happens in this part: Sam screams at Gollum, Frodo defends Gollum, Gollum speaks to himself, Frodo is in mortal danger and Sam saves him.  They've been doing the very same thing over and over again since the beginning of The Two Towers.Then the other part: also a replay of The Two Towers, I'm afraid.  Orcs attack a human stronghold and the humans barely survive.  The battle is even the same: everything is almost lost and then re-enforcements arrive saving the day. It's also quite obvious that Viggo Mortenssen was a very bad choice for a pivotal part in this movie.  His acting is wooden and his courageous speech before the battle is so powerless, mainly because of his wimpy voice and his foreign accent doesn't help either.The ending starts about half an hour before the credits and just keeps going on and on. Aragon is crowned king and that should have been it.  But no, they need to sugar coat everyone's exit till it almost made me throw up.Ok, the source material does dictate how it ends (although the ending of the book was better), but it could've been made better by just ending after the coronation.So 3 out 3 movies that were only half interesting.  So, maybe time for a new cut with only the interesting parts (about three hours for the whole lot would do).

                (2003) The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King FANTASY/ ACTION(Contains spoiler warnings) After seeing the first two ""Lord of the Ring"" films, I have to say that the longer version should've been the one to be shown to audiences since upon watching this shorter version, I was baffled about the status of Sauroman and Snake which was never elaborated at all on this short version! There was also a longer interaction scene on other scenes as well and would help the status regarding some of it's other characters not adressed on the shorter version but is elaboritated more on the longer version especially on Eowyn which upon seeing the shorter version was completely cut off and felt was necessary to be shown here since she was the one who finished the main guy! The shorter version just showed Eowyn hand in hand with the injured guy without the audience wondering how their relationship came about! And although, the battle scenes seemed to be intact in the third, what's interesting about all three ""Lord of the Ring"" films are that at the end of each film consist of different styles of battle, whereas on the first one, it was alot of one on one combat without the use of any CGI. On ""The Two Towers"", the second battle had the use of CGI but the battle was very full forced, while the orcs were standing ground. Finally, in ""The Return of the King"" somewhat of a final battle included oliphants which the good and bad guys all were fighting was very sporadic or all over the place! SHORTER VERSION gets 90% about 3.5 since some things should've been addressed but still effective, nonetheless! LONGER VERSION gets 4 out of 4 for it's completion. Winner of 11 Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director for Peter Jackson.

                I've just seen this on the big screen for the first time since I saw it at London's sadly now long-gone Odeon at Marble Arch, which - at the time - boasted the biggest screen in the UK, and it has lost little of it's magic. Continuing with the interwoven tales of ""Frodo"", ""Sam"" and their treacherous guide ""Gollum"" as they trek through fire and brimstone to get the ring to Mount Doom; whilst Gandalf, Aragorn and the surviving members of the fellowship try to stem the might of ""Sauron"" and his armies of orcs and their allies. While this is undoubtedly a magnificent piece of cinema, I find the story drags a bit. I found the the focus to be too much on the less interesting characters - the lovelorn ""Eowyn"" (Miranda Otto); the delusional ""Denethor"" (John Noble) and decent but rather wimpish ""Faramir"" (David Wenham) as ""Gondor"" faces the wrath of their nemesis, and that slows the pace from the action just when it ought to be building. The delightful, friendly, rivalry between ""Gimli"" & ""Legolas"" features all too sparingly and it's got too ponderous a narrative to sustain the four hours the otherwise visionary Peter Jackson has created. Fortunately, the triple-header quest with Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and a superb Andy Serkis keep the other strand moving along suspensefully and tensely. The battle scenes are superb, though - when we get them, the effects really do rise to the occasion and, of course, the striking cinematography coupled with the inspired themes from Howard Shore contribute to a thoroughly entertaining adaptation of a thoroughly captivating fantasy adventure. If you make it past the start of the credits, there is the gloriously haunting ""Into the West"" from Annie Lennox to top off this finest of trilogies. The Oscar/BAFTA awards this achieved are a just reward for years of stunningly creative effort from thousands of people who turned the imagination of a 20th Century English academic into films that will last forever.

                I loved it! No doubt about it, spectaculair effects, battles etc. But, and there's a big but, the movie doesn't add anything new to the trilogy. In the first part we could marvel at the wonderfull world of Tolkien that Peter Jackson so brilliantly captured on the big screen. In part two, there was action, battles and magnificent special effects.But what does part 3 have? More of the same. It had to be made, to complete the story and Peter Jackson did a great job. But especially the last hour was almost boring. After the twentieth happy-ending-swelling-music-scene, I was almost begging for the end. Still, I loved it, but maybe that was more because of the first two movies, or because of the book.....

                I loved the first two LOTR films, and was keyed up almost beyond endurance to see ROTK the first week it opened. When the film was over, I was stunned by the depth of disappointment I was feeling. In fact, I went back and watched the movie again a few days later; I could not believe that it really had been as bad as I'd experienced. The fault must have been mine, I thought; I'd been too wound up to really take it in. With a cooler head, I'd be able to enjoy it and the magic would work again, as it had with the previous two movies. Alas, no. The movie was just as bad as I'd thought, and it somehow managed to posthumously poison my pleasure in the other two movies as well. I've never been able to enjoy any of them since.I came to really hate Peter Jackson, especially after watching all the ""making of"" interviews on the dvds. I believe he is an undisciplined, self-indulgent egomaniac, and these characteristics progressively took over as the film series continued. Fellowship of the Ring was the best of the lot, and I feel it's because it was a gamble. Now that the series is over, people forget that before FOTR premiered, there was no guarantee that the film would be a success. LOTR was a notoriously difficult book to adapt, and many worried that it couldn't be done. In that atmosphere, Jackson and his co-writers were at their most deferential to the original Tolkien text, and almost humble in their approach to such a daunting task.After FOTR was a big success, they became more confident in their own skills, and felt bold enough to try a little rewriting for The Two Towers, even while assuring fans that it was only a little strategic reorganizing, and the original story would be preserved in ROTK. By that point, however, Jackson was so deluded by the sycophantic flattery that surrounded him on all sides, he was convinced that the fans would adoringly accept anything he filmed, simply because it was the product of such a genius. ROTK could not contain both Tolkien's story and Jackson's ego, and guess which won in the end? The story flopped all over the place, with Saruman's storyline simply chopped off and left unresolved, while Jackson wasted time indulging in invented scenes back in Rohan, when the story should have moved decisively to Gondor. That, however, was not the part of the story that interested him, so we had to have more loving photography of carved dark wood beams and animal-skin rugs, plus a vastly overdrawn love connection between Eowyn and Aragorn. When Jackson finally had to tear himself away from this romantic Viking paradise and turn to Gondor, he revenged himself on the story by turning Gondor into a sterile, dead cement city, full of cowards and idiots.Worst of all, I felt that by ROTK Jackson was even getting sloppy on what had been a trademark of the films until then - set design and scale. For a scene where Gandalf and Pippin are on a balcony, looking towards Minas Morgul, he had both actors on the same set, with Pippin merely kneeling at the balcony, while Gandalf towered over him. However, the brain can quite clearly calculate that the scale of the balcony in relation to the bodies of both characters is wrong - in FOTR, Jackson would have built a larger-scale model of the balcony for Pippin, to keep up the illusion that he was a smaller figure in a setting made for people of Gandalf's size. This time, he couldn't be bothered, as if he felt that he'd paid his dues being accurate in the first two movies, and now he should be free to play around and have fun.That was amply demonstrated with the stupid green goblins, the endless battle scenes, the noise, the shaking camera, and the labored ""humour"" in every Gimli scene. What annoyed me the most, however, was that Jackson seemed to have no grasp of what Tolkien thought was important. In the movie, only the ""stars"" are able to act (and yes, that includes the Hobbits), whereas Tolkien showed that nobility, courage and heroism are EVERYONE's business. In the books, the individual soldiers of Gondor had personalities, felt connected to the greater cause, and debated how best they could do their duty. In Jackson's movies, Aragorn and Gandalf do all the fighting, while crowds of women blubber helplessly and soldiers blunder about uselessly. This is why his removal of the Scouring of the Shire was both execrable and inevitable. Jackson can't recognize any drama in ordinary people in ordinary settings facing crisis and either failing or rising to the occasion - to him, the Shire is just dumb peasants who were too stupid not to leave home for adventure, and there's nothing more to be expected of them. Tolkien's whole theme was that adventure and crisis are NOT the sole property of noble heroes, but that it can touch anyone, and how we react when it does is as important as Aragorn's struggle with Sauron or Denethor's descent into madness.

                I loved the first two movies. In fact, I liked Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers so much I watched them five times.Unfortunately, The Return of the King seemed a rather big overkill for me - it seemed too rushed - poorly edited - an overindulgent overkill.The scenes were all pretty epic in the book - but Jackson juiced it up too much.I didn't like the charge of the Riders of Rohan - it just looked so... fake for some reason.The scene when the Eye of Sauron topples over - was so laughable.I really wanted to like it but I just couldn't. I'm sorry.And to top it off - we get Annie Lennox singing that song at the end - I like Lennox - but I just found her version of this song lackluster. Goodness knows why ROTK scooped up all the Academy Awards. They should have given it all to FOTR instead.

                Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (2003): Dir: Peter Jackson / Cast: Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Andy Serkis: Easily the best of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and certainly an improvement over the spectacles that came before it. It is a film about promise as Aragorn leads the battle against progressing evil forces. Frodo and Sam quest to rid the ring into a fire. There are giant spiders, hovering dragons, towering ogres, trolls, and multi-tusked elephants all aimed at the film's exciting finale. Perhaps a few battles long, yet everything comes together with so much more meaning. That is all thanks to director Peter Jackson who seems to be adding not only the finishing touches to the trilogy but also a much needed crown jewel. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf the wizard who oversaw this quest from its core beginning. Solid returns by Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Sam who conflict with the Gollum while questing to finally destroy the ring. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn finally becomes King but not without a number of massive battles to prove its worthiness. Andy Serkis steals every scene consumed within the visual character of the Gollum, out to deceive our heroes and possess the ring. It drives a message of good over evil with courage, honor and glorious special effects. An impressive finish deserving many pleasant returns. Score: 9 / 10

                LOTR-3 is probably the most astonishing achievement in computerized effects in film history - a masterpiece in this field, and it will stay so for a long time. I is a great piece of visual arts, and a good film in many other respects - well acted and directed, complex plot, with many interesting threads. However, in my opinion it fails to be the masterpiece that some viewers see in it. For the many of us who did not read the book the plot is still not very much more than a legend, which fails to bear too deep meanings. And although the last series is a little bit more human and touching than the previous ones, many of the characters are still one-dimensional. The biggest failure is however the ending - very long and redundant. If the film ended 20 minutes earlier, it would have been better.
Nevertheless, these minus points are small compared to the high level of the camera work, visual and sound effects and production. It is probably the best film of the year, and it gets 9 out of 10 on my personal scale.

                Ahh, the great finale of the most awarded film franchise in history. Just like 'Fellowship of the Ring', 'Return of the King' is fast-paced and exciting. It offers more action, more adventure, more danger, and more suspense.We learn more about Smeagol, who he was and how he came to be Gollum. He is - in my opinion - still the most intriguing character in the series, and one of the best and most memorable characters ever created for film. He is wonderfully voiced by the very talented Andy Serkis.Although all three films were filmed simultaneously, the photography and visuals does seem better here. It's also interesting that the visuals are still jaw-dropping by today's standards, considering this was made almost two decades ago. (In fact, the visuals are better than most of today's visuals...). Some of the action sequences truly are mind boggling. They are brutal, fast-paced and thrilling. The attention to detail is immaculate. The make-up is fantastic and the creature designs are innovative and fascinating.Pippin, who - together with Merry - mostly served as a comic relief character in the previous two films, is given more purpose. I also only now understand the significance of Rohan, which didn't make much sense (to me) in 'The Two Towers'. 'Return of the King' successfully ties all the loose ends and offers explanation for many of the events in the previous films. Save the best for last, as the saying goes. Well, yes, I suppose it does! 'Lord of the Rings: Return of the King' is a spectacular display of CGI integrated with practical effects. It is an adventure unlike any other, and a satisfying conclusion to an incredible movie franchise. This was sensational!

                Gondor comes under attack from Sauron's armies as Frodo, Sam and Gollum reach Mordor.This is an action-heavy, crowd pleasing final chapter to the trilogy that gives a satisfying conclusion. Like other fantasy-adventure movie sagas it involves mass conflict, suspense, glory and reflection.Amongst all the spectacular action scenes and beautiful imagery there are moments that stand out for me. The lighting of the beacons, the charge of the Rohirrim, Eowyn's girl-power moment, Aragorn whispering ""For Frodo"", and all scenes involving the hobbits are brilliantly done, particularly Frodo's ending.As with the previous two movies your opinion of Peter Jackson's take on the source material will likely influence your enjoyment of 'Return of the King'. The pacing of this film for me is slightly better than 'The Two Towers', but personally I think the sense of hopelessness followed by elation generated by the Battle of Helms Deep is never quite matched by the spectacle here at Minas Tirith. Also by the time it rushes the characters to the Battle of the Morannon, my senses feel quite saturated by large scale battle sequences.That being said these are only minor gripes in a largely excellent movie. What I particularly appreciate is that it does not end in total celebration and glory. Tolkien acknowledged the damage war does to the soul as an important theme in the book, and I'm glad this is incorporated into the film's arc for the character Frodo.Much like 'The Two Towers' the visual spectacle and CGI dominate far more than the characters and performances. The movie has great computer animated sequences that are par for the course now in large scales Hollywood movies, but it is a totally different cinematic art form than the type of movies I regard to be classic cinema. I won't name any, but let's just say they rely on great cinematography, editing, sound, and performances above digital effects. That's not to say that this movie does not contain the above, as it does, but the computer programming for me dominates mostly everything. One example is the scene where Theoden gives his rallying speech before the Rohirrim attack the Orc infantry. This should be a moment where Bernard Hill's presence commands your attention, but it's difficult to sometimes make out every word he is saying. This is not the actor's fault, it is how he is filmed and the clarity of the audio.The cast are all solid as in the previous movies. Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan and Miranda Otto have the best opportunities to shine on a pretty crowded screen. For me the standout performance once again is Andy Serkis.Looking back at the trilogy with today's streaming services in mind, I wonder if Jackson ever wonders if he could have done a better service to Tolkien's imagination with a series.For me an 8.5/10 but I round upwards.

                Considering the hype, box office numbers, Oscars and everything else, the Lord of the Rings trilogy has been for a lot of people the highlight of film making these last couple of years. And even without very much liking it, as a person who did not read the books and though I feel that everybody was just overdoing it, I must congratulate Peter Jackson and his team of cast and crew by accomplishing just that. Maybe, when things cool down a bit and other projects take their place in the spotlights, I can honestly get over the fact that all those people who think this is how movies should be, clearly outnumber the people like myself who see it as a good, but ultimately failed attempt on producing a wonderful trilogy from a no doubt inspiring book.Peter Jackson did not have an easy job by filming the trilogy, and I will give you an example on how to work with a silly part of the trilogy (I at least assume that the next passage is in the book somewhere as well). It's when Frodo is attacked by the huge spider, and taken to a castle of the orks (or similar nasty creatures).In the next scene, we see how 2 orks get into a fight over I think a piece of clothing. Everybody (that is, the other orks) have their say in it and a huge brawl starts. So when Sam comes to the castle to save his master Frodo, he finds thousands of Orks dead on the ground, only having to kill about 4 of them before getting to the top of the tower, where Frodo is held.Now, in any other movie that takes itself remotely serious, these events would be laughable, ridiculous, the movie would be slammed for it. But here comes the nice part: because it is 'in the book', Jackson gets away with these silly little facts. As he got away with the fact that the whole and entire army of Sauron go on and take on the army, not one noticing the two little hobbits and the creature called Gollem. And there are other examples, like the death and rise (apparently) from Gandalf in part 2, the oh-so easy defeat of Saruman when some silly looking trees come to action... the plot holes are endless.I will be clear: because of above reasons (amongst others), I do not think highly of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It started out with the rather boring Fellowship, went on with the loud but ultimately silly Two Towers, and ended with the incredibly disappointing and not satisfying Return of the King, the least of the three. It's too long, with lulls everywhere and a complete lack of decent acting because of the overuse of CGI. It's boring, silly and not to be taken seriously. It's, in one word, a drag, in particular for people who did not read the books, or didn't take much fun into them.So, in the end, there's a trilogy here that has ruled the box office and that special night somewhere in february nowadays, but I am not convinced one bit. And somehow I don't think I will be any time in the future...As for Return of the King: 4/10.

                I reckon it is because we know of the successful ending to the story that takes all the surprises from the script. I was disappointed nonetheless: Every word spoken is ""heavy"" and full of ""meaning"", the battle scene with the riders taking on the elephants is outright stupid-silly. No smart military leader would ever have ordered to attack such foe head-on (and still succeed...). You could bet that in each and every new scene, trouble was only about 30 seconds away. Very annoying. Did Aragon ever smile once? Always looked like having a big tummy ache. Any of the others smiling? OK, Gandalf did once, I think. The end was as kitchy as it could be - and incomprehensible, to me at least: Why would Frodo choose to leave the Shire?? It may be in the book or not, I don't care. This just didn't make any sense.^Technically of course it was more than state of the art, but even this got me bored eventually. I was glad when this part and the whole series was finally over.This project would have been better served in a TV series of say 900 minutes or so. Of course, it would have lost the big-screen ""oversize"" which was nice most of the times. But the movies as long as they were did not do justice to the books. Probably no movie(s) could ever achieve this.

                This film marks the end of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, based on the epic novel by J.R.R. Tolkien. As in the other two films, it maintained the same cast and crew. In this film, the plot comes to an end with the arrival of Sam and Frodo to Mordor and the villain's defeat. But we can't analyze this movie with justice if we look at it without consider the two that preceded it. The trilogy managed to keep the sense of unity and cohesion. In practice, it functions as a single film, with many hours long and divided into three parts. So, speaking of one of them is, obligatorily, talk about the three in the same way that, to understand the action of this film, is necessary to watch first the two films that preceded it.And if the two previous films have delighted the audience with amazing and grand scenes, it will continue the work. I speak not only of huge battles (distinction for the siege of Minas Tirith), but also the amazing landscapes of New Zealand, where many of the outdoor scenes of the trilogy were shot. The abundant use of technological resources and computerization allowed scenes that seem truly impossible, such as the fight sequence at the Black Gate and the collapse of Barad Dur tower. The characterization of the characters also deserves a special care, and to prove it just watch the feet of the hobbit's or the ears of the elves.Tension, mystery, suspense and adrenaline run through the film from start to finish and holding the audience, that follows the characters in their fight against evil. The cast is impeccable, the performances were superb and the soundtrack became iconic. Into the hands of Howard Shore, it helped him to consecrate himself as one of the biggest names in music for film, along with Enio Morriconne or Hans Zimmer.

                When you invest years following a story as good as rings there is always a small dark place in your heart that is filled with the worry 'what if the ending sucks?'. Well ROTK is a very satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.Its a sweeping ride across massive landscapes intertwining multiple story arcs into their spectacular conclusions.One could argue that the movies 9 endings is a bit over the top but I actually liked that each aspect was given a full conclusion, after this much time I didn't want to ask 'what happened to ...?'.A day spent with the 3 extended editions of the trilogy is a day well spent.

                The core of the final film in Peter Jackson's mammoth 'Lord of the Rings' series is Frodo's journey to destroy the Ring, assisted by Sam and opposed by the ever-desperate Gollum.  At the end of 'The Two Towers', Gollum had sworn to kill the hobbits and take the ring for himself - at the start of this film they (or at least, Frodo) still see him as a friend.  So there's scope for conflict there which is exploited admirably.The other main storyline concerns the quest of Aragorn to reclaim his crown - will the king overcome all enemies and claim his birthright?  'The Return of the King' is darker and more bloody than the preceding films as the full force of Sauron and the enemies of man, elf, dwarf, and hobbit regroup and find their strength.We see a decaying Gondor lost somewhere in time, with Denethor (powerfully played by John Noble) wandering in distain of his surviving son, Faramir, and mourning the loss of his great child Boromir.  We see the young hobbits Merry and Pippin both grow up and serve with distinction in battle, while Gandalf, now the all-powerful white wizard, rallies the armies to victory.Four scenes stand out for me - Aragorn and Legolas commanding the hidden armies to join their king one last time; Frodo's battle with the spider; the final confrontation between Frodo, Gollum and the Ring (although I was disappointed at the decision to make the last key fight an invisible one); and the final grateful bow of Aragorn to his little friends.Is 'Return of the King' exciting?  Yes, there are many meaty battles and situations here.  Is it involving and touching?  Yes - with Elijah Wood and Sean Astin giving their all as Frodo and Sam, and even Pippin making good. Not to mention the resolution of the story of Arwen and Aragorn.  Is it the best film of the three?  I'm not sure.  For me, the huge scale of the first film, the beauty of Rivendell, the innocence of Middle Earth, the heart-stopping appearance of the Balrog, possibly had the edge.  Is this version of 'The Lord of the Rings' really worth the hype?  As a nine-hours plus film, undoubtedly.

                Sorry folks, but this film is nowhere near as good as some gushing people on IMDB seem to think. I do notice more +ve comments in the US than the UK.OK, so the visual effects are good. So what? Jackson had the technology available to do that. He needs to do much more than employ them effectively to produce a film worthy of greatness. This isn't great, indeed it's barely good.The film is full of flaws. Important plotlines are absent, as noted by a few others here. To name but a few:the palantir cast by Wormtongue out of Orthanc in the book simply appears in the pool. This is absurd. It's the most valuable thing in the tower (as Gandalf tells Pippin in the book). This happens because Jackson has cut Saruman out entirely from film III. This is a terrible mistake. Having made so much of Saruman in I and II it just leaves a hole in III full of the unexplained. Jackson's error occurs because he should have put the full fall of Saruman at the end of II (as in the book).Eowyn's love for Aragorn is much stronger in the films than the book. The problem with this is that she simply stands idly by whilst Aragorn takes the limp character of Arwen to him. There is no development of the love between Eowyn and Faramic which in part answers the aforementioned in the book.Eowyn's slaying of the witch king of Angmar is one of the best moments of the book - a truly wondrous occurrence. In the film it is hacked in two halves whilst we await Aragorn's arrival by boat. Even the tossing of her golden hair is underplayed so much that it's anticlimactic for those of us who know the book well.Faramir's character is completely changed from the book. He now appears less nice than Boromir, which is deeply problematic and raises a major flaw in why he releases the ring from his grasp.Sorry everyone but much as I like Gollum he is little more than a CGI cartoon character. If you like computer games, fine. If you want a bit of realism, not.Am I alone in finding the slaying of the poor oliphaunt by Legolas sad? I felt sorry for the creature.the John Merrick style leader of the Orcs is one of the worst creature-creations I've seenSam is awful. For those of you who like Sean Austin ... o dear. I think this may be a British / American thing. Some of those around me in the cinema started laughing at his toe-curlingly awful soppiness. Truly dreadful. The plausibly simple gardener of the book is now transformed into a college philosopher, and it's not a pretty spectacle.the moment when the hobbits appear to bounce over Frodo's bed is another soppy Jackson moment. Again, people in the cinema in London laughed at it. Even if Tolkien did intend a slight homosexual underplay to their relationships, I don't think he'd have admired Jackson heavy-handidness here.the scouring of the shire has gone altogether. Maybe that was right, but part of the whole point of this epic tale is that simple folk rise up against the mighty, and then have to confront that evil on their doorstep.the Shire is hideously twee, with not a petal out of place. Argh. If that's paradise give me the Emyn Muil any day!and finally, after more than 10 hours the demise of Sauron is dreadfully anti-climactic. The particularly silly portrayal of Sauron as a 1970's electrical storm-lamp is part of the problem here. Instead of personifying him, we have the demise of a 'thing' for which I felt no satisfaction at all. Dull.we then have to endure another 40 minutes as the movie drifts away into a confused ending, with a terrible prosthetic-Bilbo (looking like Salieri in Amadeus).If this wins an Oscar other than for special effects it will be a scandal. But then, since when has that mattered. Afterall, if Titanic can win them it shows that the appetite for drivel is unassuaged.

                An outstanding end to the trilogy.I expected a lot from 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' so I am delighted to see it produce on so many levels. I, funnily enough, wouldn't actually say it's necessarily the most perfect execution - what with the plot coincidences and extreme character armour. But that doesn't matter one jot whatsoever, as the story wraps up in arguably the best way - at least to watch - possible. It has so much heart and feeling to it.The story involving the characters of Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and Andy Serkis remained the most interesting to me, I was very satisfied with how it concluded in regards to them. I also enjoyed the bits we got of Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen & Co. All that added to the beautiful look and creation of the film, with the world coming alive splendidly.If I were to nit-pick further, I would say the run time is slightly too long. The pacing is absolutely fine, very good in fact, but I coulda done without a few of the many end scenes - a lot of which are necessary and welcome, but a couple could've been left out to allow the viewer to imagine how the world continued. That's just how I feel mind, I'm sure I'm one of only a few that think that way.Back onto the positives: how about those battle sequences? Astonishingly good. A sensational trilogy, no question about it. I look forward to seeing 'The Hobbit' films.

                'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' is the concluding chapter in the 'Lord of the Rings' Trilogy, and i must say, it concluded amazingly. The movie starts off with a dark backstory of Smeagol, which when I say dark, I mean dark. You see Smeagol murder his friend Deagol (or lover?) in which you realise how quickly the ring will poison men's minds - even to the point where one would murder a friend to have it. From here you see Smeagol deteriorate and become what we know as Gollum and it's just a really dark segment, but it provides a necessary backstory to the character. I must mention that there is one character in this movie that I despise of more than any character i have seen in any movie: Denethor, Boromir's father who pretty much scorns his second born son Faramir. It's obvious that Faramir has been trying to prove his worthiness to his father for some time, but when Denethor says to his son that he had wished he had died instead of Boromir, you can't as the viewer help but feel as broken-hearted as Faramir. I mean, imagine your father said that to you; that he had wished you had died instead of your brother. You'd feel grief-stricken. The look on Faramir's face in conjunction with the sorrowful music playing in the background makes it such a powerful scene. With watery eyes Faramir then says, ""Since you were robbed of Boromir, I will do what I can in his stead"", so then Faramir gathers his men to ride back out to Osgiliath in a fruitless battle to reclaim the city. It's such a sad scene because you know Faramir does not have enough men to reclaim the city, but he goes anyway to uphold the honour he has for his brother and halfwitted father. The whole scene is in slo- motion with Pippin singing sadly in the background as the Orcs draw their bows to kill Faramir and his men charging towards the overrun city. It's just all so sad and I'm pretty certain this scene will be very potent and indelible in my mind. In the battle for Minasterith Aragon saves the day with his army of the undead, which to me pretty much felt like him putting in a cheat code and just demolishing every Orc, Troll and Mumakil on the battlefield. And this leads me to another point - Gimli and Legolas's friendship. I loved watching their friendship grow stronger and seeing these two characters learn to tolerate each other over the three films. I also cherish the humour in their relationship, I mean how can you not laugh after Legolas impressively takes down a Mumakil all by himself and Gimli, apathetically comments, ""That still only counts as one!"" I love scenes like this that lighten-up the mood of solemn situations. One of the stand out performances, however, in the entire movie is by Samwise Gamgee. As the voice of reason in Frodo's head, Sam tries to tell him that Gollum is plotting to kill both of them and take the ring for himself, but because Gollum can empathise with Frodo, he believes Gollum's stories. When Frodo is poisoned and paralysed by Shelob (the giant spider) I really enjoyed seeing Sam battle her and be all courageous and brave and dexterous. As Frodo becomes weaker Sam needs to become stronger, and that's exactly what happens. When the two Hobbits finally reach the volcano Sam determinedly carries Frodo up the mountain to the entrance that really demonstrates his development as a character, in which the ring is later finally destroyed. It was interesting to see Gollum hold the ring close to his chest as he falls down into the pit of lava, yet even as he's sinking and burning and dying his one thought is to try save the ring. It just shows how evil can be tenacious and follow people to their death. In essence, I felt this movie was the perfect way to end such a memorable trilogy. Peter Jackson did a superb job to make all the characters unique and significant in their own way and encapsulate what life is like during Middle Earth. The setting, the costumes, the characters, the CGI and the story were all presented perfectly in a trilogy that will never be forgotten.

                The Return of the King is the renowned final chapter in Peter Jackson's legendary Lord of The Rings film trilogy. The films in this trilogy are widely considered to be some of the greatest fantasy films ever made.It is a testament to the quality of Return of the King that it is without a doubt the best film in the trilogy. The story, characters, world building, and cinematography all combine to create one of the most magnificent franchise finales of all time.The Return of the King boasts an emotionally powerful and moving story of how sheer perseverance, love, loyalty, and friendship are more important qualities than mere physical strength. It also brilliantly showcases how even the smallest person can accomplish great feats of heroism and courage. These were always the core themes of Lord of the Rings and this film makes sure they take center stage in the narrative.The story is also brilliantly grounded in human emotion which makes for a very emotionally stirring watch. Many of the most powerful scenes in the film are after the great battles have died down and the characters share intimate, bittersweet, and touching moments with each other. Some of these moments are enough to bring tears from nearly anyone's eyes.This timeless story is elevated by what can only be described as a near flawless cast. The amount of acting talent on display here is astounding with greats like Sir lan Mckellen, Viggo Mortensen, Andy Serkis, Karl Urban, and Orlando Bloom all giving memorable acting performances in an enormous ensemble cast. The performances of this top notch cast perfectly bring the characters to life and help to immerse the audience into the film's captivating world.The Return of the King's spectacular visuals are some of the finest in the history of blockbuster filmmaking. The larger than life cinematography vividly conveys the unimaginable vastness of Middle Earth. Grand sweeping shots of mountain ranges, nearly endless fields, volcanoes, gigantic ancient cities, and other arresting vistas are shown with stunning detail. The way Jackson effortlessly blends CGI locales with real places in these shots is astonishing and something I have not seen done nearly as well in any other movie outside of the other Lord of the Rings films.On the subject of CGI, the special effects work for this film is truly state of the art. The impossibly realistic motion capture on Gollum's face, along with the marvellously sinister monster and creature designs are both impressive to behold.This great special effects work and the audacious cinematography both work in perfect union during any of The Return of the King's jaw dropping battle sequences. The battles in this film simply must be seen to be believed. I do not speak lightly when I say that Return of The King has some of the most epic, breathtaking, and blood pumping battle scenes in movie history. Peter Jackson's excellent direction and the overwhelming visual spectacle of these scenes are enough to make them endlessly exciting on every re-watch.These unbelievable action sequences are enhanced further by a chilling and awe inspiring musical score by composer Howard Shore. This phenomenal soundtrack also permeates the film's more quiet character moments too where it is serene and beautiful to listen to. It works wonders to elevate these scenes as wellOverall, The Lord of The Rings: The Return of The King is one of the purest examples of an emotional rollercoaster you will find in American Cinema. It can make you cry, cheer, and smile like almost no other film. It is a timeless grand epic and a true landmark in the fantasy film genre.

                Just wow!This movie is just mind-blowing in every aspect-the climax, the battles, the cinematography and effects, everything! I don't usually cry watching movies anymore, but man, this one shook me. All the characters you've come to grow and love are finally pitted together for one last glorious finale, and it couldn't have been better.The lore and story of this series is so richly detailed and magical yet fits perfectly in the trilogy, and The Return of the King is easily the greatest adaption of the three. The odds are finally stacked here in the endgame and who dies does die for good.This movie is easily in my top three favorites of all time and stands as an ultimate epic of one of the greatest stories of good vs evil of all time!

                Well, I think I said in my review of TTT that I was afraid that Jackson and company wouldn't be able to fit in all that was left. Now, though I have not seen the extended cut (longer than the cut of _Napoleon_, I believe!), it looks like they added much of it back there.As a Tolkien geek of 30+ years I was greatly impressed by these films even though I miss much of the subtlety of the book itself. However, that subtlety is not entirely lost; instead, it is often taken up in the acting. Bernard Hill and Miranda Otto actually make *more* of their characters than the books do. All of the Hobbits are fine, Andy Serkis is better than fine, and Ian Holm, bless him, gives all the young ones lessons in sly scene stealing. Ian McKellen is a bit too subdued at times, but when he hits the mark he's very powerful. Elves are basically impossible to play, but all of the actors in those roles do well even if Orlando Bloom is a bit callow.The revelation throughout all three films, though, is Viggo Mortensen. I hated him immediately upon his entrance in the first film, then quickly started to reassess as the film moved on. I quickly realized that he managed to hit every single one of even the deepest notes of the character, a man who is not only skilled beyond his first appearance but whose nature as a hero and a king is based in millennia of history and inheritance. It is an amazing performance, one of the best I have ever seen, and so strong that even though the end of the film was naturally without him I missed his character, just as I do every time I read the book.So, enjoy the CGI. But watch the acting - that's where you'll get the depth of the tale.

                Antipodean director Peter Jackson here proves beyond doubt that he's picked up Spielberg's mantle as the director most competent at blending dazzling special effects with convincing emotional drama. The third part of Jackson's opus sees the One Ring return to Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit, while the hordes of Gorgoroth sweep into the realm of man in their tens of thousands. Bad Taste this ain't.This is the boldest of the three movies in that it necessarily must take the most risks in depicting Tolkien's universe. It's a delicate balancing act. For instance, some will love the Jackson of old re-emerging for the Paths of the Dead sequence, while others will resent its Temple of Doom comedy-horror stylings. Legolas skipping up the leg of an olyphaunt and then sliding down its trunk as it falls: fanboys loathe that stuff; the kids love it. But thankfully, due to Return of the King's structure - a series of action scenes built around Gandalf's (Ian McKellen) dreadful narration - one doesn't have to wait long until the next set-piece arrives. And we're spoiled for choice. Gandalf, for example, doesn't only narrate - he also, exhilaratingly, sweeps onto the plain of Pelennor to ward off the Nazgul with a blinding shaft of light. Shelob doesn't disappoint; Weta have created a memorable monster who tickles the neck-hairs of Tolkien devotees and unsuspecting arachnophobics alike (I had not yet read the novel at this point...). And the lighting of the beacons, erupting from far snow-capped peaks, calling to Gondor under the bellowing strains of Howard Shore's aptly triumphant score, might be the single most rousing sequence in movie history. It's the ignition of hope, a glimmer of unbridled joy before the darkness descends.The biggest omission from the novel is the Scouring of the Shire. I happen to agree with the screenwriters' decision. By that time, we've already had two or three endings. We've been stuffed with a veritable feast in the form of the Battle of Pelennor and the Fall of Sauron; the Scouring, I believe, would have been an unwanted dessert. Besides, Tolkien's epilogue was something of a matter of celebrity. Aragorn's final words to the hobbits, as all of Middle Earth kneels, says more about the height of their standing than any Shire-war would.Some minor flaws still remain. Legolas and Gimli's character arcs still reach no real resolution (but then, do we really need another two endings?). The position of the Battle of Pelennor in the story's narrative doesn't really lend itself to the classical Hollywood narrative very comfortably - there's a predictable, albeit only slight, feeling of 'winding down' in all that follows. Also, on this extended DVD, the point at which we are asked to change discs comes at a most inopportune time, as the drums of war are at their peak.But it seems strangely impertinent to sniff out the trilogy's few flaws; to do so is like picking at the hem of the Bayeux Tapestry. Will we ever see such a wholly satisfying series of films again? Not in my lifetime. (N.B. The score is for all three.) This is pure cinema. Jackson and his creative family just don't stop giving. He has successfully translated his love for his source material and created a body of work that will live on and become equally loved. The scope of his achievement is undeniable; as entertainment, this is about as close to perfection as cinema will get.

                So, this is the end and what an anti-climax it is. The Two Towers showed some promise, although half of it bored my pants off.Here again only half the movie is interesting.  The Frodo and Sam part is so boring and repetitive I just needed to use my Fast Forward button to get through it.  This is what happens in this part: Sam screams at Gollum, Frodo defends Gollum, Gollum speaks to himself, Frodo is in mortal danger and Sam saves him.  They've been doing the very same thing over and over again since the beginning of The Two Towers.Then the other part: also a replay of The Two Towers, I'm afraid.  Orcs attack a human stronghold and the humans barely survive.  The battle is even the same: everything is almost lost and then re-enforcements arrive saving the day. It's also quite obvious that Viggo Mortenssen was a very bad choice for a pivotal part in this movie.  His acting is wooden and his courageous speech before the battle is so powerless, mainly because of his wimpy voice and his foreign accent doesn't help either.The ending starts about half an hour before the credits and just keeps going on and on. Aragon is crowned king and that should have been it.  But no, they need to sugar coat everyone's exit till it almost made me throw up.Ok, the source material does dictate how it ends (although the ending of the book was better), but it could've been made better by just ending after the coronation.So 3 out 3 movies that were only half interesting.  So, maybe time for a new cut with only the interesting parts (about three hours for the whole lot would do).

                (2003) The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King FANTASY/ ACTION(Contains spoiler warnings) After seeing the first two ""Lord of the Ring"" films, I have to say that the longer version should've been the one to be shown to audiences since upon watching this shorter version, I was baffled about the status of Sauroman and Snake which was never elaborated at all on this short version! There was also a longer interaction scene on other scenes as well and would help the status regarding some of it's other characters not adressed on the shorter version but is elaboritated more on the longer version especially on Eowyn which upon seeing the shorter version was completely cut off and felt was necessary to be shown here since she was the one who finished the main guy! The shorter version just showed Eowyn hand in hand with the injured guy without the audience wondering how their relationship came about! And although, the battle scenes seemed to be intact in the third, what's interesting about all three ""Lord of the Ring"" films are that at the end of each film consist of different styles of battle, whereas on the first one, it was alot of one on one combat without the use of any CGI. On ""The Two Towers"", the second battle had the use of CGI but the battle was very full forced, while the orcs were standing ground. Finally, in ""The Return of the King"" somewhat of a final battle included oliphants which the good and bad guys all were fighting was very sporadic or all over the place! SHORTER VERSION gets 90% about 3.5 since some things should've been addressed but still effective, nonetheless! LONGER VERSION gets 4 out of 4 for it's completion. Winner of 11 Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director for Peter Jackson.

                I've just seen this on the big screen for the first time since I saw it at London's sadly now long-gone Odeon at Marble Arch, which - at the time - boasted the biggest screen in the UK, and it has lost little of it's magic. Continuing with the interwoven tales of ""Frodo"", ""Sam"" and their treacherous guide ""Gollum"" as they trek through fire and brimstone to get the ring to Mount Doom; whilst Gandalf, Aragorn and the surviving members of the fellowship try to stem the might of ""Sauron"" and his armies of orcs and their allies. While this is undoubtedly a magnificent piece of cinema, I find the story drags a bit. I found the the focus to be too much on the less interesting characters - the lovelorn ""Eowyn"" (Miranda Otto); the delusional ""Denethor"" (John Noble) and decent but rather wimpish ""Faramir"" (David Wenham) as ""Gondor"" faces the wrath of their nemesis, and that slows the pace from the action just when it ought to be building. The delightful, friendly, rivalry between ""Gimli"" & ""Legolas"" features all too sparingly and it's got too ponderous a narrative to sustain the four hours the otherwise visionary Peter Jackson has created. Fortunately, the triple-header quest with Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and a superb Andy Serkis keep the other strand moving along suspensefully and tensely. The battle scenes are superb, though - when we get them, the effects really do rise to the occasion and, of course, the striking cinematography coupled with the inspired themes from Howard Shore contribute to a thoroughly entertaining adaptation of a thoroughly captivating fantasy adventure. If you make it past the start of the credits, there is the gloriously haunting ""Into the West"" from Annie Lennox to top off this finest of trilogies. The Oscar/BAFTA awards this achieved are a just reward for years of stunningly creative effort from thousands of people who turned the imagination of a 20th Century English academic into films that will last forever.

                I loved it! No doubt about it, spectaculair effects, battles etc. But, and there's a big but, the movie doesn't add anything new to the trilogy. In the first part we could marvel at the wonderfull world of Tolkien that Peter Jackson so brilliantly captured on the big screen. In part two, there was action, battles and magnificent special effects.But what does part 3 have? More of the same. It had to be made, to complete the story and Peter Jackson did a great job. But especially the last hour was almost boring. After the twentieth happy-ending-swelling-music-scene, I was almost begging for the end. Still, I loved it, but maybe that was more because of the first two movies, or because of the book.....

                I loved the first two LOTR films, and was keyed up almost beyond endurance to see ROTK the first week it opened. When the film was over, I was stunned by the depth of disappointment I was feeling. In fact, I went back and watched the movie again a few days later; I could not believe that it really had been as bad as I'd experienced. The fault must have been mine, I thought; I'd been too wound up to really take it in. With a cooler head, I'd be able to enjoy it and the magic would work again, as it had with the previous two movies. Alas, no. The movie was just as bad as I'd thought, and it somehow managed to posthumously poison my pleasure in the other two movies as well. I've never been able to enjoy any of them since.I came to really hate Peter Jackson, especially after watching all the ""making of"" interviews on the dvds. I believe he is an undisciplined, self-indulgent egomaniac, and these characteristics progressively took over as the film series continued. Fellowship of the Ring was the best of the lot, and I feel it's because it was a gamble. Now that the series is over, people forget that before FOTR premiered, there was no guarantee that the film would be a success. LOTR was a notoriously difficult book to adapt, and many worried that it couldn't be done. In that atmosphere, Jackson and his co-writers were at their most deferential to the original Tolkien text, and almost humble in their approach to such a daunting task.After FOTR was a big success, they became more confident in their own skills, and felt bold enough to try a little rewriting for The Two Towers, even while assuring fans that it was only a little strategic reorganizing, and the original story would be preserved in ROTK. By that point, however, Jackson was so deluded by the sycophantic flattery that surrounded him on all sides, he was convinced that the fans would adoringly accept anything he filmed, simply because it was the product of such a genius. ROTK could not contain both Tolkien's story and Jackson's ego, and guess which won in the end? The story flopped all over the place, with Saruman's storyline simply chopped off and left unresolved, while Jackson wasted time indulging in invented scenes back in Rohan, when the story should have moved decisively to Gondor. That, however, was not the part of the story that interested him, so we had to have more loving photography of carved dark wood beams and animal-skin rugs, plus a vastly overdrawn love connection between Eowyn and Aragorn. When Jackson finally had to tear himself away from this romantic Viking paradise and turn to Gondor, he revenged himself on the story by turning Gondor into a sterile, dead cement city, full of cowards and idiots.Worst of all, I felt that by ROTK Jackson was even getting sloppy on what had been a trademark of the films until then - set design and scale. For a scene where Gandalf and Pippin are on a balcony, looking towards Minas Morgul, he had both actors on the same set, with Pippin merely kneeling at the balcony, while Gandalf towered over him. However, the brain can quite clearly calculate that the scale of the balcony in relation to the bodies of both characters is wrong - in FOTR, Jackson would have built a larger-scale model of the balcony for Pippin, to keep up the illusion that he was a smaller figure in a setting made for people of Gandalf's size. This time, he couldn't be bothered, as if he felt that he'd paid his dues being accurate in the first two movies, and now he should be free to play around and have fun.That was amply demonstrated with the stupid green goblins, the endless battle scenes, the noise, the shaking camera, and the labored ""humour"" in every Gimli scene. What annoyed me the most, however, was that Jackson seemed to have no grasp of what Tolkien thought was important. In the movie, only the ""stars"" are able to act (and yes, that includes the Hobbits), whereas Tolkien showed that nobility, courage and heroism are EVERYONE's business. In the books, the individual soldiers of Gondor had personalities, felt connected to the greater cause, and debated how best they could do their duty. In Jackson's movies, Aragorn and Gandalf do all the fighting, while crowds of women blubber helplessly and soldiers blunder about uselessly. This is why his removal of the Scouring of the Shire was both execrable and inevitable. Jackson can't recognize any drama in ordinary people in ordinary settings facing crisis and either failing or rising to the occasion - to him, the Shire is just dumb peasants who were too stupid not to leave home for adventure, and there's nothing more to be expected of them. Tolkien's whole theme was that adventure and crisis are NOT the sole property of noble heroes, but that it can touch anyone, and how we react when it does is as important as Aragorn's struggle with Sauron or Denethor's descent into madness.

                I loved the first two movies. In fact, I liked Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers so much I watched them five times.Unfortunately, The Return of the King seemed a rather big overkill for me - it seemed too rushed - poorly edited - an overindulgent overkill.The scenes were all pretty epic in the book - but Jackson juiced it up too much.I didn't like the charge of the Riders of Rohan - it just looked so... fake for some reason.The scene when the Eye of Sauron topples over - was so laughable.I really wanted to like it but I just couldn't. I'm sorry.And to top it off - we get Annie Lennox singing that song at the end - I like Lennox - but I just found her version of this song lackluster. Goodness knows why ROTK scooped up all the Academy Awards. They should have given it all to FOTR instead.

                Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (2003): Dir: Peter Jackson / Cast: Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Andy Serkis: Easily the best of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and certainly an improvement over the spectacles that came before it. It is a film about promise as Aragorn leads the battle against progressing evil forces. Frodo and Sam quest to rid the ring into a fire. There are giant spiders, hovering dragons, towering ogres, trolls, and multi-tusked elephants all aimed at the film's exciting finale. Perhaps a few battles long, yet everything comes together with so much more meaning. That is all thanks to director Peter Jackson who seems to be adding not only the finishing touches to the trilogy but also a much needed crown jewel. Ian McKellen returns as Gandalf the wizard who oversaw this quest from its core beginning. Solid returns by Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Sam who conflict with the Gollum while questing to finally destroy the ring. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn finally becomes King but not without a number of massive battles to prove its worthiness. Andy Serkis steals every scene consumed within the visual character of the Gollum, out to deceive our heroes and possess the ring. It drives a message of good over evil with courage, honor and glorious special effects. An impressive finish deserving many pleasant returns. Score: 9 / 10

                LOTR-3 is probably the most astonishing achievement in computerized effects in film history - a masterpiece in this field, and it will stay so for a long time. I is a great piece of visual arts, and a good film in many other respects - well acted and directed, complex plot, with many interesting threads. However, in my opinion it fails to be the masterpiece that some viewers see in it. For the many of us who did not read the book the plot is still not very much more than a legend, which fails to bear too deep meanings. And although the last series is a little bit more human and touching than the previous ones, many of the characters are still one-dimensional. The biggest failure is however the ending - very long and redundant. If the film ended 20 minutes earlier, it would have been better.
Nevertheless, these minus points are small compared to the high level of the camera work, visual and sound effects and production. It is probably the best film of the year, and it gets 9 out of 10 on my personal scale.

                Ahh, the great finale of the most awarded film franchise in history. Just like 'Fellowship of the Ring', 'Return of the King' is fast-paced and exciting. It offers more action, more adventure, more danger, and more suspense.We learn more about Smeagol, who he was and how he came to be Gollum. He is - in my opinion - still the most intriguing character in the series, and one of the best and most memorable characters ever created for film. He is wonderfully voiced by the very talented Andy Serkis.Although all three films were filmed simultaneously, the photography and visuals does seem better here. It's also interesting that the visuals are still jaw-dropping by today's standards, considering this was made almost two decades ago. (In fact, the visuals are better than most of today's visuals...). Some of the action sequences truly are mind boggling. They are brutal, fast-paced and thrilling. The attention to detail is immaculate. The make-up is fantastic and the creature designs are innovative and fascinating.Pippin, who - together with Merry - mostly served as a comic relief character in the previous two films, is given more purpose. I also only now understand the significance of Rohan, which didn't make much sense (to me) in 'The Two Towers'. 'Return of the King' successfully ties all the loose ends and offers explanation for many of the events in the previous films. Save the best for last, as the saying goes. Well, yes, I suppose it does! 'Lord of the Rings: Return of the King' is a spectacular display of CGI integrated with practical effects. It is an adventure unlike any other, and a satisfying conclusion to an incredible movie franchise. This was sensational!

                Gondor comes under attack from Sauron's armies as Frodo, Sam and Gollum reach Mordor.This is an action-heavy, crowd pleasing final chapter to the trilogy that gives a satisfying conclusion. Like other fantasy-adventure movie sagas it involves mass conflict, suspense, glory and reflection.Amongst all the spectacular action scenes and beautiful imagery there are moments that stand out for me. The lighting of the beacons, the charge of the Rohirrim, Eowyn's girl-power moment, Aragorn whispering ""For Frodo"", and all scenes involving the hobbits are brilliantly done, particularly Frodo's ending.As with the previous two movies your opinion of Peter Jackson's take on the source material will likely influence your enjoyment of 'Return of the King'. The pacing of this film for me is slightly better than 'The Two Towers', but personally I think the sense of hopelessness followed by elation generated by the Battle of Helms Deep is never quite matched by the spectacle here at Minas Tirith. Also by the time it rushes the characters to the Battle of the Morannon, my senses feel quite saturated by large scale battle sequences.That being said these are only minor gripes in a largely excellent movie. What I particularly appreciate is that it does not end in total celebration and glory. Tolkien acknowledged the damage war does to the soul as an important theme in the book, and I'm glad this is incorporated into the film's arc for the character Frodo.Much like 'The Two Towers' the visual spectacle and CGI dominate far more than the characters and performances. The movie has great computer animated sequences that are par for the course now in large scales Hollywood movies, but it is a totally different cinematic art form than the type of movies I regard to be classic cinema. I won't name any, but let's just say they rely on great cinematography, editing, sound, and performances above digital effects. That's not to say that this movie does not contain the above, as it does, but the computer programming for me dominates mostly everything. One example is the scene where Theoden gives his rallying speech before the Rohirrim attack the Orc infantry. This should be a moment where Bernard Hill's presence commands your attention, but it's difficult to sometimes make out every word he is saying. This is not the actor's fault, it is how he is filmed and the clarity of the audio.The cast are all solid as in the previous movies. Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, Ian McKellen, Dominic Monaghan and Miranda Otto have the best opportunities to shine on a pretty crowded screen. For me the standout performance once again is Andy Serkis.Looking back at the trilogy with today's streaming services in mind, I wonder if Jackson ever wonders if he could have done a better service to Tolkien's imagination with a series.For me an 8.5/10 but I round upwards.

                Considering the hype, box office numbers, Oscars and everything else, the Lord of the Rings trilogy has been for a lot of people the highlight of film making these last couple of years. And even without very much liking it, as a person who did not read the books and though I feel that everybody was just overdoing it, I must congratulate Peter Jackson and his team of cast and crew by accomplishing just that. Maybe, when things cool down a bit and other projects take their place in the spotlights, I can honestly get over the fact that all those people who think this is how movies should be, clearly outnumber the people like myself who see it as a good, but ultimately failed attempt on producing a wonderful trilogy from a no doubt inspiring book.Peter Jackson did not have an easy job by filming the trilogy, and I will give you an example on how to work with a silly part of the trilogy (I at least assume that the next passage is in the book somewhere as well). It's when Frodo is attacked by the huge spider, and taken to a castle of the orks (or similar nasty creatures).In the next scene, we see how 2 orks get into a fight over I think a piece of clothing. Everybody (that is, the other orks) have their say in it and a huge brawl starts. So when Sam comes to the castle to save his master Frodo, he finds thousands of Orks dead on the ground, only having to kill about 4 of them before getting to the top of the tower, where Frodo is held.Now, in any other movie that takes itself remotely serious, these events would be laughable, ridiculous, the movie would be slammed for it. But here comes the nice part: because it is 'in the book', Jackson gets away with these silly little facts. As he got away with the fact that the whole and entire army of Sauron go on and take on the army, not one noticing the two little hobbits and the creature called Gollem. And there are other examples, like the death and rise (apparently) from Gandalf in part 2, the oh-so easy defeat of Saruman when some silly looking trees come to action... the plot holes are endless.I will be clear: because of above reasons (amongst others), I do not think highly of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It started out with the rather boring Fellowship, went on with the loud but ultimately silly Two Towers, and ended with the incredibly disappointing and not satisfying Return of the King, the least of the three. It's too long, with lulls everywhere and a complete lack of decent acting because of the overuse of CGI. It's boring, silly and not to be taken seriously. It's, in one word, a drag, in particular for people who did not read the books, or didn't take much fun into them.So, in the end, there's a trilogy here that has ruled the box office and that special night somewhere in february nowadays, but I am not convinced one bit. And somehow I don't think I will be any time in the future...As for Return of the King: 4/10.

                I reckon it is because we know of the successful ending to the story that takes all the surprises from the script. I was disappointed nonetheless: Every word spoken is ""heavy"" and full of ""meaning"", the battle scene with the riders taking on the elephants is outright stupid-silly. No smart military leader would ever have ordered to attack such foe head-on (and still succeed...). You could bet that in each and every new scene, trouble was only about 30 seconds away. Very annoying. Did Aragon ever smile once? Always looked like having a big tummy ache. Any of the others smiling? OK, Gandalf did once, I think. The end was as kitchy as it could be - and incomprehensible, to me at least: Why would Frodo choose to leave the Shire?? It may be in the book or not, I don't care. This just didn't make any sense.^Technically of course it was more than state of the art, but even this got me bored eventually. I was glad when this part and the whole series was finally over.This project would have been better served in a TV series of say 900 minutes or so. Of course, it would have lost the big-screen ""oversize"" which was nice most of the times. But the movies as long as they were did not do justice to the books. Probably no movie(s) could ever achieve this.

                This film marks the end of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, based on the epic novel by J.R.R. Tolkien. As in the other two films, it maintained the same cast and crew. In this film, the plot comes to an end with the arrival of Sam and Frodo to Mordor and the villain's defeat. But we can't analyze this movie with justice if we look at it without consider the two that preceded it. The trilogy managed to keep the sense of unity and cohesion. In practice, it functions as a single film, with many hours long and divided into three parts. So, speaking of one of them is, obligatorily, talk about the three in the same way that, to understand the action of this film, is necessary to watch first the two films that preceded it.And if the two previous films have delighted the audience with amazing and grand scenes, it will continue the work. I speak not only of huge battles (distinction for the siege of Minas Tirith), but also the amazing landscapes of New Zealand, where many of the outdoor scenes of the trilogy were shot. The abundant use of technological resources and computerization allowed scenes that seem truly impossible, such as the fight sequence at the Black Gate and the collapse of Barad Dur tower. The characterization of the characters also deserves a special care, and to prove it just watch the feet of the hobbit's or the ears of the elves.Tension, mystery, suspense and adrenaline run through the film from start to finish and holding the audience, that follows the characters in their fight against evil. The cast is impeccable, the performances were superb and the soundtrack became iconic. Into the hands of Howard Shore, it helped him to consecrate himself as one of the biggest names in music for film, along with Enio Morriconne or Hans Zimmer.

                When you invest years following a story as good as rings there is always a small dark place in your heart that is filled with the worry 'what if the ending sucks?'. Well ROTK is a very satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.Its a sweeping ride across massive landscapes intertwining multiple story arcs into their spectacular conclusions.One could argue that the movies 9 endings is a bit over the top but I actually liked that each aspect was given a full conclusion, after this much time I didn't want to ask 'what happened to ...?'.A day spent with the 3 extended editions of the trilogy is a day well spent.

                The core of the final film in Peter Jackson's mammoth 'Lord of the Rings' series is Frodo's journey to destroy the Ring, assisted by Sam and opposed by the ever-desperate Gollum.  At the end of 'The Two Towers', Gollum had sworn to kill the hobbits and take the ring for himself - at the start of this film they (or at least, Frodo) still see him as a friend.  So there's scope for conflict there which is exploited admirably.The other main storyline concerns the quest of Aragorn to reclaim his crown - will the king overcome all enemies and claim his birthright?  'The Return of the King' is darker and more bloody than the preceding films as the full force of Sauron and the enemies of man, elf, dwarf, and hobbit regroup and find their strength.We see a decaying Gondor lost somewhere in time, with Denethor (powerfully played by John Noble) wandering in distain of his surviving son, Faramir, and mourning the loss of his great child Boromir.  We see the young hobbits Merry and Pippin both grow up and serve with distinction in battle, while Gandalf, now the all-powerful white wizard, rallies the armies to victory.Four scenes stand out for me - Aragorn and Legolas commanding the hidden armies to join their king one last time; Frodo's battle with the spider; the final confrontation between Frodo, Gollum and the Ring (although I was disappointed at the decision to make the last key fight an invisible one); and the final grateful bow of Aragorn to his little friends.Is 'Return of the King' exciting?  Yes, there are many meaty battles and situations here.  Is it involving and touching?  Yes - with Elijah Wood and Sean Astin giving their all as Frodo and Sam, and even Pippin making good. Not to mention the resolution of the story of Arwen and Aragorn.  Is it the best film of the three?  I'm not sure.  For me, the huge scale of the first film, the beauty of Rivendell, the innocence of Middle Earth, the heart-stopping appearance of the Balrog, possibly had the edge.  Is this version of 'The Lord of the Rings' really worth the hype?  As a nine-hours plus film, undoubtedly.

                Sorry folks, but this film is nowhere near as good as some gushing people on IMDB seem to think. I do notice more +ve comments in the US than the UK.OK, so the visual effects are good. So what? Jackson had the technology available to do that. He needs to do much more than employ them effectively to produce a film worthy of greatness. This isn't great, indeed it's barely good.The film is full of flaws. Important plotlines are absent, as noted by a few others here. To name but a few:the palantir cast by Wormtongue out of Orthanc in the book simply appears in the pool. This is absurd. It's the most valuable thing in the tower (as Gandalf tells Pippin in the book). This happens because Jackson has cut Saruman out entirely from film III. This is a terrible mistake. Having made so much of Saruman in I and II it just leaves a hole in III full of the unexplained. Jackson's error occurs because he should have put the full fall of Saruman at the end of II (as in the book).Eowyn's love for Aragorn is much stronger in the films than the book. The problem with this is that she simply stands idly by whilst Aragorn takes the limp character of Arwen to him. There is no development of the love between Eowyn and Faramic which in part answers the aforementioned in the book.Eowyn's slaying of the witch king of Angmar is one of the best moments of the book - a truly wondrous occurrence. In the film it is hacked in two halves whilst we await Aragorn's arrival by boat. Even the tossing of her golden hair is underplayed so much that it's anticlimactic for those of us who know the book well.Faramir's character is completely changed from the book. He now appears less nice than Boromir, which is deeply problematic and raises a major flaw in why he releases the ring from his grasp.Sorry everyone but much as I like Gollum he is little more than a CGI cartoon character. If you like computer games, fine. If you want a bit of realism, not.Am I alone in finding the slaying of the poor oliphaunt by Legolas sad? I felt sorry for the creature.the John Merrick style leader of the Orcs is one of the worst creature-creations I've seenSam is awful. For those of you who like Sean Austin ... o dear. I think this may be a British / American thing. Some of those around me in the cinema started laughing at his toe-curlingly awful soppiness. Truly dreadful. The plausibly simple gardener of the book is now transformed into a college philosopher, and it's not a pretty spectacle.the moment when the hobbits appear to bounce over Frodo's bed is another soppy Jackson moment. Again, people in the cinema in London laughed at it. Even if Tolkien did intend a slight homosexual underplay to their relationships, I don't think he'd have admired Jackson heavy-handidness here.the scouring of the shire has gone altogether. Maybe that was right, but part of the whole point of this epic tale is that simple folk rise up against the mighty, and then have to confront that evil on their doorstep.the Shire is hideously twee, with not a petal out of place. Argh. If that's paradise give me the Emyn Muil any day!and finally, after more than 10 hours the demise of Sauron is dreadfully anti-climactic. The particularly silly portrayal of Sauron as a 1970's electrical storm-lamp is part of the problem here. Instead of personifying him, we have the demise of a 'thing' for which I felt no satisfaction at all. Dull.we then have to endure another 40 minutes as the movie drifts away into a confused ending, with a terrible prosthetic-Bilbo (looking like Salieri in Amadeus).If this wins an Oscar other than for special effects it will be a scandal. But then, since when has that mattered. Afterall, if Titanic can win them it shows that the appetite for drivel is unassuaged.

                An outstanding end to the trilogy.I expected a lot from 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' so I am delighted to see it produce on so many levels. I, funnily enough, wouldn't actually say it's necessarily the most perfect execution - what with the plot coincidences and extreme character armour. But that doesn't matter one jot whatsoever, as the story wraps up in arguably the best way - at least to watch - possible. It has so much heart and feeling to it.The story involving the characters of Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and Andy Serkis remained the most interesting to me, I was very satisfied with how it concluded in regards to them. I also enjoyed the bits we got of Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen & Co. All that added to the beautiful look and creation of the film, with the world coming alive splendidly.If I were to nit-pick further, I would say the run time is slightly too long. The pacing is absolutely fine, very good in fact, but I coulda done without a few of the many end scenes - a lot of which are necessary and welcome, but a couple could've been left out to allow the viewer to imagine how the world continued. That's just how I feel mind, I'm sure I'm one of only a few that think that way.Back onto the positives: how about those battle sequences? Astonishingly good. A sensational trilogy, no question about it. I look forward to seeing 'The Hobbit' films.

                'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' is the concluding chapter in the 'Lord of the Rings' Trilogy, and i must say, it concluded amazingly. The movie starts off with a dark backstory of Smeagol, which when I say dark, I mean dark. You see Smeagol murder his friend Deagol (or lover?) in which you realise how quickly the ring will poison men's minds - even to the point where one would murder a friend to have it. From here you see Smeagol deteriorate and become what we know as Gollum and it's just a really dark segment, but it provides a necessary backstory to the character. I must mention that there is one character in this movie that I despise of more than any character i have seen in any movie: Denethor, Boromir's father who pretty much scorns his second born son Faramir. It's obvious that Faramir has been trying to prove his worthiness to his father for some time, but when Denethor says to his son that he had wished he had died instead of Boromir, you can't as the viewer help but feel as broken-hearted as Faramir. I mean, imagine your father said that to you; that he had wished you had died instead of your brother. You'd feel grief-stricken. The look on Faramir's face in conjunction with the sorrowful music playing in the background makes it such a powerful scene. With watery eyes Faramir then says, ""Since you were robbed of Boromir, I will do what I can in his stead"", so then Faramir gathers his men to ride back out to Osgiliath in a fruitless battle to reclaim the city. It's such a sad scene because you know Faramir does not have enough men to reclaim the city, but he goes anyway to uphold the honour he has for his brother and halfwitted father. The whole scene is in slo- motion with Pippin singing sadly in the background as the Orcs draw their bows to kill Faramir and his men charging towards the overrun city. It's just all so sad and I'm pretty certain this scene will be very potent and indelible in my mind. In the battle for Minasterith Aragon saves the day with his army of the undead, which to me pretty much felt like him putting in a cheat code and just demolishing every Orc, Troll and Mumakil on the battlefield. And this leads me to another point - Gimli and Legolas's friendship. I loved watching their friendship grow stronger and seeing these two characters learn to tolerate each other over the three films. I also cherish the humour in their relationship, I mean how can you not laugh after Legolas impressively takes down a Mumakil all by himself and Gimli, apathetically comments, ""That still only counts as one!"" I love scenes like this that lighten-up the mood of solemn situations. One of the stand out performances, however, in the entire movie is by Samwise Gamgee. As the voice of reason in Frodo's head, Sam tries to tell him that Gollum is plotting to kill both of them and take the ring for himself, but because Gollum can empathise with Frodo, he believes Gollum's stories. When Frodo is poisoned and paralysed by Shelob (the giant spider) I really enjoyed seeing Sam battle her and be all courageous and brave and dexterous. As Frodo becomes weaker Sam needs to become stronger, and that's exactly what happens. When the two Hobbits finally reach the volcano Sam determinedly carries Frodo up the mountain to the entrance that really demonstrates his development as a character, in which the ring is later finally destroyed. It was interesting to see Gollum hold the ring close to his chest as he falls down into the pit of lava, yet even as he's sinking and burning and dying his one thought is to try save the ring. It just shows how evil can be tenacious and follow people to their death. In essence, I felt this movie was the perfect way to end such a memorable trilogy. Peter Jackson did a superb job to make all the characters unique and significant in their own way and encapsulate what life is like during Middle Earth. The setting, the costumes, the characters, the CGI and the story were all presented perfectly in a trilogy that will never be forgotten.

                When a film series or trilogy receives as impeccable a treatment a J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings,"" its nearly impossible for its grand finale to falter. Such is the case of ""The Return of the King,"" an absolutely colossal conclusion to Peter Jackson's epic vision.Considering a majority of ""Return of the King"" is payoff for being patient in the previous two chapters, the film is the most fun of the three and the biggest crowd pleaser. If you loved the previous films, you can't not love this one more. It's not necessarily that the film is better. Rather, it's so tonally and structurally consistent with the other films that by virtue of being the end, it stands out as an incredible experience, hence its winning of the Oscar for Best Picture.After the Battle of Helm's Deep and the defeat of Isengard, the armies of Mordor move on Gondor and the city of Minas Tirith. With King Theoden (Bernard Hill) of Rohan wary of giving all his muscle to the men of Gondor, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) ride there to convince the steward of Gondor, Denethor (John Noble), the mourning father of Boromir, to extend his hand to Rohan and in effect, to Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) heir to the throne and rightful king of Gondor, a title the ranger struggles with.The War of the Ring is something to behold, even though it's interrupted by Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam's (Sean Astin) quest to cast the Ring back into the fires of Mt. Doom. Rather than having the forces of Sauron and the armies of Gondor and Rohan clash in a tense battle in which the victor remains unclear, the story sets the battle up to have two extreme sides, namely that we spend a majority of the battle scenes watching Minas Tirith get torn to pieces wondering how good can possibly triumph.On the other end, we know that Gollum (Andy Serkis) has plans to betray Frodo and Sam in order to repossess his one and only Precious. The debate between the two hobbits on whether Gollum can be trusted reaches its zenith in a heartbreaking way seeing as we are aware of Gollum's intentions, and by this point, with the Ring reaching Mordor, it calls out for its master and consequently has a horrible effect on Frodo.The story pushes certain failure to the brink in both the War of the Ring and in Frodo and Sam's quest to destroy the Ring, and it's easy enough to buy every ounce of it despite knowing it can't possibly end in a horrible way. That's testament to the power of the storytelling going on here.How ""Return of the King"" really one ups ""The Two Towers"" is that it doesn't feel as though its bouncing around nearly as much between the different story lines even though it is. The momentum of the impending battle and Frodo and Sam inching closer and closer to Mt. Doom keep things on edge and driving forward at all times. No scene feels obligatory or like its stalling, and even some creative scene juxtaposition such as Pippin singing to Denethor as Faramir charges into battle only makes the script appear even stronger.From an action and visual spectacle standpoint, ""Return of the King"" completely outdoes the previous chapters. A battle sequence in which Legolas (Orlando Bloom) takes down an entire oliphant on his own sums up the quality of the film in the most basic entertainment sense. Even with all the doom and gloom, there's still plenty of humor in this one as well.The resolution of the many subplots also helps to improve the overall quality of ""Two Towers"" in the context of the trilogy just by providing payoff to all the story lines that film built yet to which it gave no resolution. Everything that Eowyn (Miranda Otto) does in ""Two Towers"" feel for naught by the end of that film, but she gets her shining moment in ""Return of the King"" that brings her character full circle. ""Return of the King"" works well on its own, but it also proves that ""The Lord of the Rings"" was meant to be watched together as a trilogy, as lots of small details in the first two films pay bigger dividends in the finale. Jackson certainly proved why the entire trilogy needed to be filmed together as a complete entity; you couldn't just hold off on the rest of the series if ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" didn't pan out financially.The emotional payoff of the film is testament to the work on all ends of production, for everything from the script to the on-screen talent to the set decorators to the sound designers creates the aura of authenticity that makes this fantasy feel so real and convincing, while also pulling us along on an emotional journey in which we feel so heavily invested by the time Frodo and Sam reach the summit of Mt. Doom. As with their journey in the story, once you've gone this far as a viewer, you're incredibly committed to the outcome, and what an outcome. Bravo.~Steven CThanks for reading!

                I was one of the few fortunate souls who's company does business with New Line Cinema, and we were treated to a sneak peak at Return of the King five days before its release.  I'm a huge fan of both the first and second movies.  And I think the third outdoes them both.  Visually, I sat for three hours twenty stunned.  The third movie remained as faithful to the book as I could possibly imagine.  The only complaint I can think of, ***SPOILER ALERT*** is that I didn't like Legolas sliding down the trunk of the Oliphant.  (Much like I didn't like him riding a shield down the stairs in The Two Towers.)  But that is so minor that it wouldn't even scratch the perfect 10 that I give this movie.  I could already see the parts that were left out for the extended version and I can't wait to see that.  All that's left to say is, thank you to Peter Jackson and everyone else involved in this movie for giving us everything we could possibly imagine.One last note:  Make sure the theater you see it at plays this movie LOUD. When we watched the walls shook.  And the screams of the Nazgul made our eyes water and skin run cold. :)

                I reckon it is because we know of the successful ending to the story that takes all the surprises from the script. I was disappointed nonetheless: Every word spoken is ""heavy"" and full of ""meaning"", the battle scene with the riders taking on the elephants is outright stupid-silly. No smart military leader would ever have ordered to attack such foe head-on (and still succeed...). You could bet that in each and every new scene, trouble was only about 30 seconds away. Very annoying. Did Aragon ever smile once? Always looked like having a big tummy ache. Any of the others smiling? OK, Gandalf did once, I think. The end was as kitchy as it could be - and incomprehensible, to me at least: Why would Frodo choose to leave the Shire?? It may be in the book or not, I don't care. This just didn't make any sense.^Technically of course it was more than state of the art, but even this got me bored eventually. I was glad when this part and the whole series was finally over.This project would have been better served in a TV series of say 900 minutes or so. Of course, it would have lost the big-screen ""oversize"" which was nice most of the times. But the movies as long as they were did not do justice to the books. Probably no movie(s) could ever achieve this.

                This film marks the end of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, based on the epic novel by J.R.R. Tolkien. As in the other two films, it maintained the same cast and crew. In this film, the plot comes to an end with the arrival of Sam and Frodo to Mordor and the villain's defeat. But we can't analyze this movie with justice if we look at it without consider the two that preceded it. The trilogy managed to keep the sense of unity and cohesion. In practice, it functions as a single film, with many hours long and divided into three parts. So, speaking of one of them is, obligatorily, talk about the three in the same way that, to understand the action of this film, is necessary to watch first the two films that preceded it.And if the two previous films have delighted the audience with amazing and grand scenes, it will continue the work. I speak not only of huge battles (distinction for the siege of Minas Tirith), but also the amazing landscapes of New Zealand, where many of the outdoor scenes of the trilogy were shot. The abundant use of technological resources and computerization allowed scenes that seem truly impossible, such as the fight sequence at the Black Gate and the collapse of Barad Dur tower. The characterization of the characters also deserves a special care, and to prove it just watch the feet of the hobbit's or the ears of the elves.Tension, mystery, suspense and adrenaline run through the film from start to finish and holding the audience, that follows the characters in their fight against evil. The cast is impeccable, the performances were superb and the soundtrack became iconic. Into the hands of Howard Shore, it helped him to consecrate himself as one of the biggest names in music for film, along with Enio Morriconne or Hans Zimmer.

                When you invest years following a story as good as rings there is always a small dark place in your heart that is filled with the worry 'what if the ending sucks?'. Well ROTK is a very satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.Its a sweeping ride across massive landscapes intertwining multiple story arcs into their spectacular conclusions.One could argue that the movies 9 endings is a bit over the top but I actually liked that each aspect was given a full conclusion, after this much time I didn't want to ask 'what happened to ...?'.A day spent with the 3 extended editions of the trilogy is a day well spent.

                The core of the final film in Peter Jackson's mammoth 'Lord of the Rings' series is Frodo's journey to destroy the Ring, assisted by Sam and opposed by the ever-desperate Gollum.  At the end of 'The Two Towers', Gollum had sworn to kill the hobbits and take the ring for himself - at the start of this film they (or at least, Frodo) still see him as a friend.  So there's scope for conflict there which is exploited admirably.The other main storyline concerns the quest of Aragorn to reclaim his crown - will the king overcome all enemies and claim his birthright?  'The Return of the King' is darker and more bloody than the preceding films as the full force of Sauron and the enemies of man, elf, dwarf, and hobbit regroup and find their strength.We see a decaying Gondor lost somewhere in time, with Denethor (powerfully played by John Noble) wandering in distain of his surviving son, Faramir, and mourning the loss of his great child Boromir.  We see the young hobbits Merry and Pippin both grow up and serve with distinction in battle, while Gandalf, now the all-powerful white wizard, rallies the armies to victory.Four scenes stand out for me - Aragorn and Legolas commanding the hidden armies to join their king one last time; Frodo's battle with the spider; the final confrontation between Frodo, Gollum and the Ring (although I was disappointed at the decision to make the last key fight an invisible one); and the final grateful bow of Aragorn to his little friends.Is 'Return of the King' exciting?  Yes, there are many meaty battles and situations here.  Is it involving and touching?  Yes - with Elijah Wood and Sean Astin giving their all as Frodo and Sam, and even Pippin making good. Not to mention the resolution of the story of Arwen and Aragorn.  Is it the best film of the three?  I'm not sure.  For me, the huge scale of the first film, the beauty of Rivendell, the innocence of Middle Earth, the heart-stopping appearance of the Balrog, possibly had the edge.  Is this version of 'The Lord of the Rings' really worth the hype?  As a nine-hours plus film, undoubtedly.

                Sorry folks, but this film is nowhere near as good as some gushing people on IMDB seem to think. I do notice more +ve comments in the US than the UK.OK, so the visual effects are good. So what? Jackson had the technology available to do that. He needs to do much more than employ them effectively to produce a film worthy of greatness. This isn't great, indeed it's barely good.The film is full of flaws. Important plotlines are absent, as noted by a few others here. To name but a few:the palantir cast by Wormtongue out of Orthanc in the book simply appears in the pool. This is absurd. It's the most valuable thing in the tower (as Gandalf tells Pippin in the book). This happens because Jackson has cut Saruman out entirely from film III. This is a terrible mistake. Having made so much of Saruman in I and II it just leaves a hole in III full of the unexplained. Jackson's error occurs because he should have put the full fall of Saruman at the end of II (as in the book).Eowyn's love for Aragorn is much stronger in the films than the book. The problem with this is that she simply stands idly by whilst Aragorn takes the limp character of Arwen to him. There is no development of the love between Eowyn and Faramic which in part answers the aforementioned in the book.Eowyn's slaying of the witch king of Angmar is one of the best moments of the book - a truly wondrous occurrence. In the film it is hacked in two halves whilst we await Aragorn's arrival by boat. Even the tossing of her golden hair is underplayed so much that it's anticlimactic for those of us who know the book well.Faramir's character is completely changed from the book. He now appears less nice than Boromir, which is deeply problematic and raises a major flaw in why he releases the ring from his grasp.Sorry everyone but much as I like Gollum he is little more than a CGI cartoon character. If you like computer games, fine. If you want a bit of realism, not.Am I alone in finding the slaying of the poor oliphaunt by Legolas sad? I felt sorry for the creature.the John Merrick style leader of the Orcs is one of the worst creature-creations I've seenSam is awful. For those of you who like Sean Austin ... o dear. I think this may be a British / American thing. Some of those around me in the cinema started laughing at his toe-curlingly awful soppiness. Truly dreadful. The plausibly simple gardener of the book is now transformed into a college philosopher, and it's not a pretty spectacle.the moment when the hobbits appear to bounce over Frodo's bed is another soppy Jackson moment. Again, people in the cinema in London laughed at it. Even if Tolkien did intend a slight homosexual underplay to their relationships, I don't think he'd have admired Jackson heavy-handidness here.the scouring of the shire has gone altogether. Maybe that was right, but part of the whole point of this epic tale is that simple folk rise up against the mighty, and then have to confront that evil on their doorstep.the Shire is hideously twee, with not a petal out of place. Argh. If that's paradise give me the Emyn Muil any day!and finally, after more than 10 hours the demise of Sauron is dreadfully anti-climactic. The particularly silly portrayal of Sauron as a 1970's electrical storm-lamp is part of the problem here. Instead of personifying him, we have the demise of a 'thing' for which I felt no satisfaction at all. Dull.we then have to endure another 40 minutes as the movie drifts away into a confused ending, with a terrible prosthetic-Bilbo (looking like Salieri in Amadeus).If this wins an Oscar other than for special effects it will be a scandal. But then, since when has that mattered. Afterall, if Titanic can win them it shows that the appetite for drivel is unassuaged.

                An outstanding end to the trilogy.I expected a lot from 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' so I am delighted to see it produce on so many levels. I, funnily enough, wouldn't actually say it's necessarily the most perfect execution - what with the plot coincidences and extreme character armour. But that doesn't matter one jot whatsoever, as the story wraps up in arguably the best way - at least to watch - possible. It has so much heart and feeling to it.The story involving the characters of Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and Andy Serkis remained the most interesting to me, I was very satisfied with how it concluded in regards to them. I also enjoyed the bits we got of Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen & Co. All that added to the beautiful look and creation of the film, with the world coming alive splendidly.If I were to nit-pick further, I would say the run time is slightly too long. The pacing is absolutely fine, very good in fact, but I coulda done without a few of the many end scenes - a lot of which are necessary and welcome, but a couple could've been left out to allow the viewer to imagine how the world continued. That's just how I feel mind, I'm sure I'm one of only a few that think that way.Back onto the positives: how about those battle sequences? Astonishingly good. A sensational trilogy, no question about it. I look forward to seeing 'The Hobbit' films.

                'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' is the concluding chapter in the 'Lord of the Rings' Trilogy, and i must say, it concluded amazingly. The movie starts off with a dark backstory of Smeagol, which when I say dark, I mean dark. You see Smeagol murder his friend Deagol (or lover?) in which you realise how quickly the ring will poison men's minds - even to the point where one would murder a friend to have it. From here you see Smeagol deteriorate and become what we know as Gollum and it's just a really dark segment, but it provides a necessary backstory to the character. I must mention that there is one character in this movie that I despise of more than any character i have seen in any movie: Denethor, Boromir's father who pretty much scorns his second born son Faramir. It's obvious that Faramir has been trying to prove his worthiness to his father for some time, but when Denethor says to his son that he had wished he had died instead of Boromir, you can't as the viewer help but feel as broken-hearted as Faramir. I mean, imagine your father said that to you; that he had wished you had died instead of your brother. You'd feel grief-stricken. The look on Faramir's face in conjunction with the sorrowful music playing in the background makes it such a powerful scene. With watery eyes Faramir then says, ""Since you were robbed of Boromir, I will do what I can in his stead"", so then Faramir gathers his men to ride back out to Osgiliath in a fruitless battle to reclaim the city. It's such a sad scene because you know Faramir does not have enough men to reclaim the city, but he goes anyway to uphold the honour he has for his brother and halfwitted father. The whole scene is in slo- motion with Pippin singing sadly in the background as the Orcs draw their bows to kill Faramir and his men charging towards the overrun city. It's just all so sad and I'm pretty certain this scene will be very potent and indelible in my mind. In the battle for Minasterith Aragon saves the day with his army of the undead, which to me pretty much felt like him putting in a cheat code and just demolishing every Orc, Troll and Mumakil on the battlefield. And this leads me to another point - Gimli and Legolas's friendship. I loved watching their friendship grow stronger and seeing these two characters learn to tolerate each other over the three films. I also cherish the humour in their relationship, I mean how can you not laugh after Legolas impressively takes down a Mumakil all by himself and Gimli, apathetically comments, ""That still only counts as one!"" I love scenes like this that lighten-up the mood of solemn situations. One of the stand out performances, however, in the entire movie is by Samwise Gamgee. As the voice of reason in Frodo's head, Sam tries to tell him that Gollum is plotting to kill both of them and take the ring for himself, but because Gollum can empathise with Frodo, he believes Gollum's stories. When Frodo is poisoned and paralysed by Shelob (the giant spider) I really enjoyed seeing Sam battle her and be all courageous and brave and dexterous. As Frodo becomes weaker Sam needs to become stronger, and that's exactly what happens. When the two Hobbits finally reach the volcano Sam determinedly carries Frodo up the mountain to the entrance that really demonstrates his development as a character, in which the ring is later finally destroyed. It was interesting to see Gollum hold the ring close to his chest as he falls down into the pit of lava, yet even as he's sinking and burning and dying his one thought is to try save the ring. It just shows how evil can be tenacious and follow people to their death. In essence, I felt this movie was the perfect way to end such a memorable trilogy. Peter Jackson did a superb job to make all the characters unique and significant in their own way and encapsulate what life is like during Middle Earth. The setting, the costumes, the characters, the CGI and the story were all presented perfectly in a trilogy that will never be forgotten.

                When a film series or trilogy receives as impeccable a treatment a J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings,"" its nearly impossible for its grand finale to falter. Such is the case of ""The Return of the King,"" an absolutely colossal conclusion to Peter Jackson's epic vision.Considering a majority of ""Return of the King"" is payoff for being patient in the previous two chapters, the film is the most fun of the three and the biggest crowd pleaser. If you loved the previous films, you can't not love this one more. It's not necessarily that the film is better. Rather, it's so tonally and structurally consistent with the other films that by virtue of being the end, it stands out as an incredible experience, hence its winning of the Oscar for Best Picture.After the Battle of Helm's Deep and the defeat of Isengard, the armies of Mordor move on Gondor and the city of Minas Tirith. With King Theoden (Bernard Hill) of Rohan wary of giving all his muscle to the men of Gondor, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) ride there to convince the steward of Gondor, Denethor (John Noble), the mourning father of Boromir, to extend his hand to Rohan and in effect, to Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) heir to the throne and rightful king of Gondor, a title the ranger struggles with.The War of the Ring is something to behold, even though it's interrupted by Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam's (Sean Astin) quest to cast the Ring back into the fires of Mt. Doom. Rather than having the forces of Sauron and the armies of Gondor and Rohan clash in a tense battle in which the victor remains unclear, the story sets the battle up to have two extreme sides, namely that we spend a majority of the battle scenes watching Minas Tirith get torn to pieces wondering how good can possibly triumph.On the other end, we know that Gollum (Andy Serkis) has plans to betray Frodo and Sam in order to repossess his one and only Precious. The debate between the two hobbits on whether Gollum can be trusted reaches its zenith in a heartbreaking way seeing as we are aware of Gollum's intentions, and by this point, with the Ring reaching Mordor, it calls out for its master and consequently has a horrible effect on Frodo.The story pushes certain failure to the brink in both the War of the Ring and in Frodo and Sam's quest to destroy the Ring, and it's easy enough to buy every ounce of it despite knowing it can't possibly end in a horrible way. That's testament to the power of the storytelling going on here.How ""Return of the King"" really one ups ""The Two Towers"" is that it doesn't feel as though its bouncing around nearly as much between the different story lines even though it is. The momentum of the impending battle and Frodo and Sam inching closer and closer to Mt. Doom keep things on edge and driving forward at all times. No scene feels obligatory or like its stalling, and even some creative scene juxtaposition such as Pippin singing to Denethor as Faramir charges into battle only makes the script appear even stronger.From an action and visual spectacle standpoint, ""Return of the King"" completely outdoes the previous chapters. A battle sequence in which Legolas (Orlando Bloom) takes down an entire oliphant on his own sums up the quality of the film in the most basic entertainment sense. Even with all the doom and gloom, there's still plenty of humor in this one as well.The resolution of the many subplots also helps to improve the overall quality of ""Two Towers"" in the context of the trilogy just by providing payoff to all the story lines that film built yet to which it gave no resolution. Everything that Eowyn (Miranda Otto) does in ""Two Towers"" feel for naught by the end of that film, but she gets her shining moment in ""Return of the King"" that brings her character full circle. ""Return of the King"" works well on its own, but it also proves that ""The Lord of the Rings"" was meant to be watched together as a trilogy, as lots of small details in the first two films pay bigger dividends in the finale. Jackson certainly proved why the entire trilogy needed to be filmed together as a complete entity; you couldn't just hold off on the rest of the series if ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" didn't pan out financially.The emotional payoff of the film is testament to the work on all ends of production, for everything from the script to the on-screen talent to the set decorators to the sound designers creates the aura of authenticity that makes this fantasy feel so real and convincing, while also pulling us along on an emotional journey in which we feel so heavily invested by the time Frodo and Sam reach the summit of Mt. Doom. As with their journey in the story, once you've gone this far as a viewer, you're incredibly committed to the outcome, and what an outcome. Bravo.~Steven CThanks for reading!

                I was one of the few fortunate souls who's company does business with New Line Cinema, and we were treated to a sneak peak at Return of the King five days before its release.  I'm a huge fan of both the first and second movies.  And I think the third outdoes them both.  Visually, I sat for three hours twenty stunned.  The third movie remained as faithful to the book as I could possibly imagine.  The only complaint I can think of, ***SPOILER ALERT*** is that I didn't like Legolas sliding down the trunk of the Oliphant.  (Much like I didn't like him riding a shield down the stairs in The Two Towers.)  But that is so minor that it wouldn't even scratch the perfect 10 that I give this movie.  I could already see the parts that were left out for the extended version and I can't wait to see that.  All that's left to say is, thank you to Peter Jackson and everyone else involved in this movie for giving us everything we could possibly imagine.One last note:  Make sure the theater you see it at plays this movie LOUD. When we watched the walls shook.  And the screams of the Nazgul made our eyes water and skin run cold. :)

                For the past week, I'd been pining to complete my rewatch of ""The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003),"" viewing the films for the first time in years. This wait, however arduous, was nothing compared to the 360 days I originally endured between 'The Two Towers (2002)' and 'The Return of the King (2003).' The drought came to an end on December 26, 2003: I remember the exact date because it was the first night of release, and I'd been counting down for the past year. We bought our tickets weeks in advance, waited in line for over an hour, and my brother emptied a packet of jelly lollies over the row in front of us while trying to get the damn packet open.And so it is that Peter Jackson's trilogy-to-end-all-trilogies finally came to a close, in truly spectacular fashion. With the armies of Mordor marching on Minas Tirith, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) must recruit the aid of alternative reinforcements if the land of Gondor, ruled by the callous steward Denethor (John Noble), is not to fall before the Great Eye of Sauron. Meanwhile, this epic conflict is contrasted against the image of two little hobbits, Frodo and Sam, dutifully trundling across the wastelands of Mordor, two innocuous Halflings carrying the weight of a million men. Once again, the film excels at these stunning contrasts. The death of Denethor, a powerful, intimate moment of self-realisation, unexpectedly bridges into the Battle for Minas Tirith, the loss of one man suddenly absorbed into the slaughter of thousands.A word of warning: arachnophobics should be weary of Frodo's excursion into Shelob's Lair, a magnificent work of grotesquerie visual effects, topped only by the ""insect pit"" in Jackson's own 'King Kong (2005).' Andy Serkis, as the computer-generated Gollum, once again brings pathos and fragility into the role of the tormented former Ring-bearer. 'The Return of the King' has perhaps the most unforgettable final hour I've ever seen, as the fate of all that is good comes down to a scrappy scuffle on the edge of a fiery precipice, this one-on-one conflict somehow more ""epic"" than the entire Battle of Helms Deep. But Peter Jackson isn't done yet. While excising Tolkien's somewhat anti-climactic ""Scouring of the Shire,"" he nevertheless brings the trilogy to a graceful, and wonderfully satisfying, close, his leisurely winding-down approach doing justice to one of the richest fantasy sagas ever told.

"262"," A bit disappointing
","duke_manga_man","5 April 2004",NA,"
                Spoilers! First of all, ROTK is my favourite book of the trilogy. There are quite a few parts of it that pack a wallop But it must have been the prevalance of special effects that removed alot of the humanity in the book. It still is a good film, but as far as epics is definetely below The Fellowship of the Ring, and Master and Commander. There are parts that work great, like the appearance of Minas Tirith and also Minas Morgul, and the change from the book regarding the lighting of the beacons did have an epic sweep. But here are the shortfalls:The battle of Minas Tirith starts good, but when the rohirrim show up, all of a sudden becomes nothing but FX. The human scale is lost. - The charge of the oliphants. Can't remember this in the book, why borrow from The Empire Strikes Back when you are working with one of the great pieces of literature? - The walk through the paths of the dead. Far more understated in the book, and more spooky and atmospheric. In the movie it is all dumbed down - This has bugged me throughout the trilogy. Legolas is a woodland elf, kind of a xenophobic country bumpkin to the high elves. The two types of elves are not too fond of each other. They definitely don't hang around. Why is Legolas presenting Arwen at the end of the film? - Slight changes (ie. the corsair fleet seems to take a back seat,and the final battle is anticlimatic) lose their impact in the translation - The fate of Saruman is omitted. He is one of the most important characters, kind of a middle earth Hitler, through which Tolkien was making a comment on his times However I did like the compacted, low key ending (I wish a bit more of the film was lower key and strove to be more visionary). 7/10

"264"," The conclusion to the wonderful epic The Lord Of The Rings: The Return Of The King.
","eaw1990osaka","18 January 2004",NA,"
                This wonderful conclusion to Peter Jackson's adaptation of .J.R.R. Tolkien's most popular written work should definetly win a few awards to say the least. The first movie, The Fellowship of the Ring, inspired me to read the trilogy.  As I was only twelve at the time, these were the first books I actually finished reading. I decided first off that no matter how much the film makers changed the story, as long as the general plot line and points that Tokien was trying to make were made in a fashion that Tolkien would have liked, I would accept these movies. These are three spectacular films, or rather, one large movie version, created by crazy Tolkien fans, of the tale of how evil came into being and how it was destroyed.For those of you who have not seen this movie, and are wondering whether or not to go and see it, by now you know clearly what I think.  This movie is the conclusion to the first two movies, or rather the conclusion to one long continuing story. If you haven't seen the first two, go and see them before you come and see this one: There's nothing worse then hearing the end of a great tale before you even get a chance to begin it. Once you start this trilogy, you will not want to be left behind. It is about how the Hobbits, Frodo(an aristocrat) and Sam (his loyal gardener and best companion), struggle on to a land called Mordor to destroy a ring that corrupts the minds of even the strongest warriors, and about how their friends try to guide and help them in their quest to save all life, even if it takes their own lives to destroy the ring. The movie is full of tales of how Middle Earth and its people are making their last and final attempts to fight the evil, and save not only their homes, wives and children, but their own humanity and souls as well. It is a tale of how life almost disappeared but when darkness almost completely covered all earth, some courageos people, whether from the sanity of their minds or rightness of their hearts gave their last shot to save life because they valued it.  They gave their last hope, said their last prayers, and were able to destroy this evil. Nothing that I can say would be good enough to put these people and their world into the right words so that you could imagine it: Just watch the movie so you can start experiencing it.

                After being disappointed with the first film, then enjoying the second enough that I actually bought both extended DVDs, I find myself back to disappointment with number 3, for several reasons.1) ROTK suffers from the same thing as FOTR: trying to cram too much story into too little time (can you believe Jackson originally wanted to do LOTR in *two* movies)?2) The CGI effects, which were never as impressive as they were cracked up to be, are now just boring.3) Jackson has finally given in to his previously (mostly) incipient I-know-better-than-Tolkien-itis. The Paths of the Dead sequence now plays like a bad horror movie (think Stephen Sommers), and the Cirith Ungol-Shelob's Lair sequence has both Frodo and Sam behaving entirely out of character. Worst of all is the Cracks of Doom scene, where Jackson for some reason feels it necessary to gild the lily by adding a (literal) cliffhanger. Also, the Scouring of the Shire is *not* (unlike Tom Bombadil or the parley with the Mouth of Sauron) dispensable. Dropping it alters the whole character of the ending.4) What was the point of having Denethor go over the cliff in flames?5) Gandalf explains to Pippin what happens after death? Tolkien must be turning in his grave. And the explanation isn't even interesting.6) But worst of all, I reread the novel between TTT and ROTK. This was a grievous error; it merely pointed up the inferiority of the films.So, anybody want to buy a couple of extended DVDs, cheap?ROTK 5/10; full series, 6/10.

                I was rather hyped for the third part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, as I suppose everyone was. Unfortunately, I found it boring and lacklustre. The Return of the King barely exhibited the epic quantity that I awaited from the finale of the trilogy. It seems that by this time, the whole crew was tired of the project. Also, the omissions and changes to Tolkien's original are most glaring in RotK. The movie just whizzed by and I failed to be impressed. Maybe the Extended Edition would prove to be a more rousing experience. The normal edition, however, despite its efforts, remains a lacking ho-hum finale to what began as an impressive filmatization of the Lord of the Rings tale.

                Where do I even begin with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy? It is one of the finest film trilogies to ever make it to the big screen. Peter Jackson was admittedly an unexpected choice of director for the trilogy. Before Lord of the Rings, he made The Frighteners, Bad Taste, Meet the Feebles, and Heavenly Creatures. Heavenly Creatures was his first step out of absurd cinema, and then after The Frighteners came out in 1996, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was released in 2001 and became a critical, commercial and prestigious success. The Two Towers had the same success in 2002, and finally The Return of the King came and was the greatest of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, and the first ever fantasy movie to win the Academy Award for Best Picture, and went on to win the BAFTA for Best Film and The Golden Globe for Best Picture - Drama.The Return of the King won all these awards for the right reasons. It was epic, gorgeous, a story that has been told consistently great from start to finish, and everything works. Lord of the Rings is one of those tales that will live on forever and ever. J.R.R. Tolkien would be extremely proud, even if his son, Christopher, isn't proud of the movies.The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King will be remembered and still be considered one of the finest movies ever made. An achievement on an epic cinematic level and a cultural milestone.

                SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!My friend asked me if I wanted to go, I said okay, but he didn't want to leave until 7:30. Of course I knew we would get bad seats, and we did. 3rd row from the very front, far, far left. My neck still hurts. I had nothing to eat or drink, people were talking throughout the opening scenes. Yet this did nothing to distract me or harm the movie in any way.Let me start off by saying and you can quote me on this ""Move over Star Wars, there's a new trilogy in cinema"" This movie (movies) are amazing. Lord of the Rings is the best trilogy out there and will be for some time. The matrix's last installment full flat, I have not seen Godfather, Evil Dead is a cult classic trilogy and Star Wars just lost the top spot. I seriously believe Jackson will get Best Director and this movie ""deserves"" to have Best Picture, even though the Academy will fuck it's chances over and this will be one of the biggest snubs ever on the Oscars.I'll begin with the CGI. If you thought the first two had great CGI, you haven't seen anything yet. Gollum, of course looks amazing and it is so believable that he is a character on the screen. ""He is there, you believe it, he is not cgi"" The way he talked to himself was better than the way it was presented in The Two Towers, the water reflection was so beautiful and imaginative. When he is atop of Frodo and bites his finger off, it was amazing; I was actually in awe, CGI on top of CGI. The battle, what an amazing battle, if you thought the battle at Helm's Deep was amazing, cool, the best, then you are in store for something spectacular. You will get your socks knocked off. The battle scene is the absolute best battle scene ever created. The bodies, the emotion, the action, the excitement, the chills, the suspense, the cheers, the tears. This battle had it all. The men who were cursed, beautiful, how they tore that motherfucker down. In Fellowship of the Ring, we see Legolas climb atop of a Cave Troll; yes it did look fake, cheesy. In Two Towers, we see him do some weird stunt to climb back onto his horse, it also looked weird and fake. In Return Of The King, he takes down the elephant and all the men on it. This wasn't fake, this wasn't weird or cheesy. It looked beautiful, it looked real, it was amazing. He did it with ease as well, and as he counted his victims, brings down the big boy, gimli (serving as comic relief only) still states that the one only counted as one.The acting, was utterly ""uber"" great. Aragorn IS the king, he is the man, the legend, Mortesen is the one and only person who can play him, who can bring him to life, he is Aragorn. Everyone did their part, and boy did I ever hate the ""filler king"" He p*ssed me off so much, I actually liked it. Merry and Pippen, were extraordinary, this movie is where they shine. Sam, I think everyone knows what a great actor Astin is, and what a GREAT job he did with Sam, I honestly believe that he should be up for supporting actor. He almost made me cry, the emotion was utterly amazing. Hate, Anger, Love, Fear, Sadness. He brought all of these emotions into this character and he did it extremely well. Frodo...what can I say, you are a troubled young...err..old hobbit. You are tired, you cannot go on...you trust the untrustworthy, you are fearful of a giant Shelob. You have courage and find the strength to go on and destroy the ring, only to be consumed by it's evil power, and want the ring for yourself. Agent Smith/Lord Elrond...one word, GREAT. I believed Liv Tyler should of had at least 5 more minutes of screen time, but with the time she did have, she made me believe that she truly was in love with Aragon and willing to become mortal.The direction, Peter Jackson is my new Favourite director. Yes, I have seen his previous films before he did Lord of the Rings, yes I loved them, but this ""EPIC"" trilogy, has made him the man. Only a true fan of Tolkien and Lord of the Rings, could of brought this masterpiece to film, creating another masterpiece. You honestly deserve to win best director, for conveying epic battle sequences, strong emotions, bringing something fake to life (Gollum). I don't know anyone else who could of done this, and if he is not behind the camera for The Hobbit, then it should not be made.The characters, one of the things that I love about the books/movies are the characters. Their fears, their anger, their courage, their optismistic approach on life. Eowyn (sp) Not very convincing in Two Towers, but amazing in this installment, I could not believe it. She is a warrior. Everyone cheered when she took off her helmet and said ""I am no man"". Then stuck that sword right into the f***er. Merry and Pippen have love for each other and you can feel it, when they say goodbye to each other, you can feel their pain, there sadness. Gimli, was really funny as well as Gandalf, who is just as always, excellently portrayed by Ian Mckellen. Everyone cheered again when Gandalf took over command of Minus Tirith (sp).The movie itself, was just brilliant. It deserves everything it gets, and should get more. I felt sad when Frodo was back at the Shire, in his little home all alone, a huge adventure had just happened, how can you go back to your normal life? You made courages friendships, with man, drawf and elf. Now you're back with hobbits, I saw their expressions in the pub, just before Sam got married (yeah all the girls cheered) I know how they feel, The adventure was EPIC, the adventure was Amazing, it's sad to watch the movies all in a row, I know I will cry when I do (not only because my ass will hurt from 9-13 hours either. My uncle asked me a year ago, what movie has changed my life, what movie made me look at movies in a different way. I didn't know the answer yet, he told me for him it was Star Wars, his whole generation loves Star Wars. Well, there is a new generation. Lord of the Rings has and will change the way we look at movies today. It has a new following (yeah, someone dressed up as a hobbit). I will have these films on DVD, Extended Edition. a friend today asked me four questions. Was it good? YES. Good enough for Best Picture? Yes. Good enough for Best Director? Yes. Where did you sit? In a bad spot.10/10

                Final chapter in Tolkien trilogy returns to the standard set by fantastic first entry. Corrects it's course from the in-comparison-only lesser Towers, which suffered from two significant faults: 1) pointless deviations from the source material, the best fantasy work ever written; and 2) a tendency to make the odds against our heroes laughably impossible. Not that this one is perfect on those counts but it tries a little harder, maybe they felt Towers needed more ummmph or something. We're talking a good 500 pages or so for Return, they do about as nice a job of stuffing the material in as they can. Pretty much flawless acting, my personal favorite being Hill as Theoden King of Rohan. Real nice job on lighting the warning beacons, a dazzling combination of sight and sound (although I still would have preferred it ""by the book"" while Gandalf and Pippin are on the fly to Gondor). I lived with these books so much as a kid I get choked up throughout this movie it's visualized so well. Tolkien was a master of having his characters (often Gandalf, sometimes Galadriel, but not always so) say the perfect lifetime-memorable line; somehow with all this effort they still miss some of the great ones. But I guess nobody's perfect. Great movie. 10 out of 10

                Commenting the first part of this novel I said that it was a real message for peace, but I cannot assert the same for this final one . Although technically this film is one of the best in its special effects, it has too many battles which make it sometimes boring, battle after battle with no space to think or to relax. It also amazed me to see that the villain of this story, i.e. Christopher Lee disappeared with no explanation. I was unsuccessfully looking for him in the film, but later learned that even the same Lee is now arguing for the exclusion of his scenes from this film. Why such a exclusion? It is a real mystery. One can guest more or less the rest of the plot, the good boys winning over the evil. In fact the end of the film is like a poem, Frodo has to go to a kind of a sweet death leaving Sam sad. This scene is certainly unexpected and makes you think that death is fatal but can be welcome when good doing has taken place. In any case, my criticism here does not demerit the success of the whole serial of these three films, but the third one should have been the best and it was not.

                The conclusion of 'The Lord of the Rings Trilogy' achieves perfection and belongs in the pantheon of the history of cinema, alongside other great epic works that take pride of place there.The philosophy of this masterpiece of literature and film teaches the values of true friendship, abnegation, courage, dedication and the qualities that make true heroes, kings and queens in the fight against the grip of darkness and once it has been overcome.The perfection of this cinematic monument won eleven Academy Awards, including Best Director for Peter Jackson and Best Picture at the 76th Academy Awards Ceremony in 2004.With its eleven awards, 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King' (2003) sits on a par with 'Ben-Hur' (1959) and 'Titanic' (1997) as the most awarded films in the history of Oscars.

                This movie best describe something i would call age of kings or castle age. Similar to computer games like Age of Empires, Cossacks, Stronghold. It motivated me to play such games because they are very similar to movie. It is emotional, realistic, moral, cultural, religious, adventuristic, magical. It reminds me of those religions such as Qur'an and movies about religions and religious war, but also other types of wars like national. Although most things in the movie are unreal, they can be compared to real life analogues such as habits, culture, manners. Everything and everybody looks so real and this is not a low quality movie. I am amazed that there is vast number of newer but worse convincing and looking movies. This one looks like it is ahead of its abilities for that time (year 2003). Meaning, even today I am amazed by graphics, quality, reality of it all. Good history lesson and good religious inspiration. It inspired me to never give up, to fight for something better, to be prepared in advance, and to not get discouraged. This movie is probably the most interesting to those interested in history, because despite most thing being fake, it shows us great deal of history, including buildings, weapons, nations, behaviors, technology, nature - like it indeed was. There is some magical feeling at the end that feels out of this world and could be best described as inspiration and insight into the victory, freedom, success, relief.

                In my lifetime so far, the best films ever made, of all time were done such as:The Godfather, Part I The Original ""Star Wars"" The Original ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" The Original ""Psycho"" The Original ""The Exorcist"" ...and more...And a whole host of others before my lifetime...and guess what!?!?I am happy to say I am glad I was alive and one of the first to see ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"", ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" and ""Lord of the Rings, Return of the King"".This last installment, was THE most brilliant and wonderful film I've ever seen in a long time. I am NOT going to give any spoilers or any information about the move for this is a movie everyone needs to see on the big screen at least once.The only pet-peeve? It is over 3 hours and I know theater owners are at a loss to run ""Intermissions"" but this is one film that should make them reconsider. People didn't WANT to miss a second of this film and were squirming in their seats...but didn't get up! This film was THAT excellent, to risk bladder control!!Oh.... in the theater: people clapped, people screamed, people jumped, people cried. (And no, I was not at a Magic Johnson Theater presentation, but I wish I was, I bet those audiences went CRAZY!!!)It has been such a long time to see this in a theater...the real reactions of an audience who were so moved by entertainment so grand, so wonderful...so EPIC in this day and time.Oscar voters, take note. If this film doesn't win this year for ""Best Picture"", there WILL be a riot. You cannot deny it this time. You just CAN'T!!!!!I hear Mr. Jackson's next venture is a remake of the classic ""King Kong"". Interesting choice but....don't worry, I'm already standing in line and waiting for that one too.An Excellent film that will last the ages....a ten out of ten.

                After the second film's release, people started making jokes. Not because it was it was a bad film(which it wasn't it was spectacular). It was because Sam and Frodo became very close. People were making gay jokes. THat was a funny time. The third and final Lord of the Rings won best picture at the Oscars and it deserved it. The final lord of the Rings film is by far the best in the trilogy. In the final chapter, every character continues they're battles. Frodo(Elijah Wood), Sam(SEan Astin)and Gullom(Andy Serkis) continue their adventure to Mount Doom. This time their get into scarier situations then ever. THey get tangled in huge spider webs and stuff. THey also figure out that Gullom was just with them to kill them and steal the ring. You also find out a little more about Gullom. THe last Lord of the Rings film is far from disappointing. It's an amazing film that will stay in you heart forever. It was very upsetting to see such a fantastic series come to an end.

                It's hard to choose which one I like more, 'Return of the King' or 'Fellowship of the Ring'. The third installment is so grand with huge battles and utter desperation. The odds are stacked against the world of men, but with alliances and a few cheat codes (army of the dead), they stand a chance. Though, everything falls on Frodo and whether he's able to complete his mission. And we see him struggle mightily.I remember the theatrical versions very clearly, so I can pretty well pick out every scene that is added in the extended versions. Throughout the trilogy the added scenes are actually almost obvious. I definitely prefer them for all the extra lore, but I would be lying if I didn't think they sometimes broke up the natural flow of the films or seemed out of place.The movie is over 4 hours long. And I loved all of it. It deserved every Academy Award it won. The number one franchise where my heart is so invested I actually don't want it to end. We got the 'Hobbit', which in my opinion doesn't come close to this trilogy. But thankfully, we get more this coming fall in TV format, 'Game of Thrones' style (as in quality and production), with at least 5 seasons planned. I can't wait.

                Peter Jackson proved himself capable of bringing J.R.R. Tolkien's long, epic novels to life, twice. These two, almost 4 hour long, movies lead up to one thing, The Return of the King. So this movie had a lot to live up to, the first film set up this magical world and set all these people on a journey to destroy the ring. And the second movie built upon the story with great action sequences and by setting the scene for the third and final movie. It could have cracked under the pressure akin to films like The Matrix Revolutions, but instead it succeeded in almost every aspect. The story, action, and accuracy to the novels are all at their finest. The growing struggle between Frodo and Samwise reaches its climax when it comes to Gollum trying to frame the latter, and when they have to destroy the ring. But in the end, their friendship shines through. And, of course, the return of the king, the namesake of the movie/novel. There is a huge battle at the end of the movie resulting in Aragorn's return to the throne, uniting all of middle earth. And the ending, THE ENDING, one of the finest in cinematic history, great enough to satisfy anyone within a five mile radius and bring a grown man to tears. What's pretty clear is the actors are really into character and are obsessed with their roles, and Peter Jackson, if nothing else, can finely craft an action sequence and proves it with this movie. In my opinion this is the best of the trilogy of finely crafted, beautifully made, intricate, accurate movies. It's one of, if not, the finest movie ever. Peter Jackson definitely knocked it out of the park with these groundbreaking, fantasy blockbusters.

                So this is the end of the trilogy. For today's standards it is the apex of epic film making and audiovisual effects. Moreover it honestly tries to follow the plot of the books (but notice I'm referring solely to the plot). The Return Of The King is a movie you simply have to see for the sake of it. Now the bad part. It is unbelievably corny! Please, guys, why did you have to make the breakup of the Fellowship just a series of end-of-summer-camp goodbyes? No respect to the spirit of Tolkien, no inner meaning, no depth. This was completely unworthy of the rest of the effort and it spoiled it for me. Perhaps the whole crew got tired of this enormous project and daubed the last 30 minutes so that they could get over it.

                The fact that this film has over 3000 reviews speaks volumes, and it is hard to know what to add that might not already have been said.Unlike at the time of release, we now have the luxury of lining up the three parts of the film and watching them through. While this is hard to achieve at one sitting, a ""watchathon"" with some breaks still does the job as it was meant to be done - with the necessary continuity.The first thing to note after that is that this is not our world.While at the very start of ""The Hobbit"" (the book), JRR Tolkien seems to toy with the suggestion that the people (""men"") in his book are like us, while hobbits are small beings that hide away from the likes of us, he clearly drops this concept further on in the same book, let alone in LOTR.So Tolkien's achievement - and the challenge for Peter Jackson - was to put on screen a whole new world in which we are observers, but not in any even remote sense participants. This is of some relevance, given the detachment needed to see the pure evil of Sauron for what it is, to go along with orcs and others being irredeemable cannon-fodder, and to accept the immortality of elves and the lengthy lifespans of the other species on show here (let alone the presence of a host of other beasts more or less supernatural and otherwise implausible).This is precisely what Jackson does achieve, and it is a triumph.And since LOTR is a portrayal of a last stand of ""the West"", it is somehow fitting and touching that the 3 films are primarily the achievement of a mix of New Zealanders, Australians, Brits and Americans; and it might reasonably be argued that, whatever the cultural future of our world, ""the West"" (and even perhaps its Anglo-Saxon sub-component) reached some kind of artistic zenith in this simply outstanding epic.Given that LOTR screenings overlapped with those of (the very British if American-funded) Harry Potter, these were rich times indeed for lovers of lengthy literary sagas entirely incapable of being turned into films and yet somehow being turned into films, even with some aplomb. They were also ""rich"" in the literal sense, given the unparalleled, if deserved, lucrativeness of both of these genres.But LOTR still stands a little above even this high-class fray, and most especially on its design side. The presentations of the civilisations and architecture and art and clothing of the Shire, of Rohan, of Gondor, of the Elves, of the Dwarfs and of Mordor are outstanding and indeed near-miraculous (as literally they need to be). The level of detail is just mind-blowing and at times gulp-making in its audacity, love and care.One sign of the alien-ness of Middle Earth, in the books and now also on film, is the way it defies time-period classification. While The Shire might even look 18th-century, Minas Tirith seems more like Mediaeval times and the Riders of Rohan even somehow late Dark Ages...Again while Hobbiton would seem familiar (to Britons especially) and has a measure of technological development, a rather Star-Warslike twist (though Middle Earth of course came first!!!) has all remaining technology in the hands of the bad guys and compiled together with magic (either that of Saruman or that of Sauron). This effect from the books also makes it through to the screen...Tolkien reflected these differences in having Baggins and co. talk in rather everyday language about things like pocket handkerchiefs, umbrellas, hedge-cutting and dishcloths (and even tobacco), while the speech of Galadriel, Elrond, Denethor and so on is far more lofty and high-register. Again the film deals with this, though to the extent that actors occasionally look a little uncomfortable delivering their lines. Frodo-Sam-Gollum interactions (for Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and an ecstatically-good Andy Serkis) are at their best when tinged with grumpiness or humour (references to ""fish and chips"" most especially), but they come close to indigestible overdose (as well as perhaps a touch of homoeroticism?) when turning to subjects more wistful.Admittedly, the lack of American accents in both Frodo and Sam is an achievement not equalled in most previous films, though it maybe happens at some cost to the delivery not apparent when native Brit Ian Holm offers his splendid portrayal of the ageing if ring-preserved Uncle Bilbo.Interestingly, Gandalf (here played memorably by Sir Ian McKellen) bridges these two worlds (as in the books), being a bringer of fireworks from The Shire's point of view, while also being a mighty wizard monarch in the story's later stages. He talks appropriately for both of these worlds! Minor issues like the above with the lines matter not to the great (and quite regularly tear-inducing) sweep of the tale; and to the joy of seeing many characters like Elrond, Theoden, Denethor, Aragorn, Arwen and Galadriel made convincing on-screen flesh thanks (respectively) to Hugo Weaving, Bernard Hill, John Noble, Viggo Mortensen (special plaudits to him), Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett.Normally, a galaxy of stars such as this might overwhelm a film, but such is the epic scale of these movies that they represent just tiny parts of a whole presented with such great wisdom against spectacular New Zealand backgrounds. These locations were the choice of genius, and genius makes its presence felt regularly enough here. Of course, that is the genius of Tolkien, but it is also the genius of Jackson and (immense) team, who never pretended they could convey every element of a story running into thousands of pages, but nevertheless surpass themselves in managing to achieve so very much.Those lucky enough to have never seen these films are thus advised to do so, whether or not fantasy is normally their kind of thing.

"285"," No word for it but...Epic.
","passthepopcorn6","22 December 2004",NA,"
                There are a few words that come to mind with this movie. Amazing, breath-taking, incredible, and supercalifrajilisticexpialidocious are some, but even those don't really get it across. If you have not seen this movie, please do yourself a favor and do so before you die.I wish I had more space to go on and on about the colossal achievement this movie set forth. The CGI Gollum set a higher standard for computer engineering today along with the trolls and oliphaunts. The score...flies. Not another word for it. And I cannot even count how many times I cried. The most heart-wrenching line? ""Don't go where I can't follow."" I couldn't find a flaw in anything this movie won its half a million (exageration) Oscars for. When you see it, you can't wonder for even a second that it won so many.Of course, being the mini-Simon Cowell I am, I do have a few points to pick. First off, I don't really find much to complain about the few things that were left out. The Scouring of the Shire, I knew right off wasn't going to be in the movie. I mean, people have just finished watching this huge epic war, and now it's finally over. A sensible director would not start an entire other battle right at the end...I know I wouldn't. The Houses of Healing was a little disappointing because you really wanted to see Eowyn with Faramir, just to finish off the entire picture, but I haven't seen the extended version yet, so I'm crossing my fingers. However, some of the things that were in the movie were a little iffy. Denethor's pyre was something I've been looking forward to ever since I read the books, it's always been my favorite part. I end up reading that chapter over and over. However, in the movie some of the things that really got at you in the book were left out. The part with his hands forever emblazoned on the palantir gave me shivers. And although watching a fiery body plunge off the wall is a very cool shot, it didn't do much for me. I missed the goosebumps the book had always given me, and I felt like that as something that could have used those few extra minutes of time on, if anything.Also, the Pippin and the palantir scene was a bit strange. The entire motion blur would have been fine if it was another movie, but compared to the rest of LoTR, it just wasn't up to par. I couldn't help but laugh when I saw it, which I'm sure wasn't the point of the scene. However, put those two sort of bad things together (Pippin's and Denethor's scenes) and what do you get? Pippin's ""All Shall Fade"" scene, which takes the cake for tear-jerkers. So you see, even if there is that one little gripe (like there is in all films) the movie as a whole, as an emotion, makes up for everything.In conclusion, even if you're a nit-picker like me, this film is one that will go down in movie history. You don't need to be a Tolkein fan or even have read the books to appreciate its majesty.

                The first two Lord of the Rings films were: enchanting, moving, astonishing, and above all spectacular. Peter Jackson delivers the third and final chapter to Lord of the Rings trilogy with a phenomenal closing! The film has it all from a great, believable story to the high film-making quality, and it contains a powerful cast.The story: The film picks up on the events from the second film. It follows the hobbits rodo and Sam, who are guided by the cursed creature Gollum, who leads them to either the depths of Mount doom to destroy the evil ring, or to their demise. During this expedition, Middle-earth may have won their first victory over evilness, but the armies of Mordor, beyond count, march to the last defense of middle-earth, the city of Gondor, in which the Wizard Gandalf the White must defend, and Aragorn the Dunedain Ranger must become the new king of his people, and lead them to salvation. These two prime stories are captured amazingly, showing who will be saved and who will be sacrificed, particularly the Frodo and Sam relationship, which is strained by the wickedness of the one ring.The film-making: Once again, Peter Jackson provides us with spectacular and unusual camera angles (the left to right technique), as well as bringing to life with eye-popping and ""ahead of its time"" visual effects. The CGI effects are used for both enhancement of the cities and structures of the settings, additional to the marvelous production and costume design and the epic battle sequences, in which armies, of thousands of both man and beast clash, astonishingly on the screen, giving ferocious intensity and thrills. Along with this, Howard Shore delivers another powerful and uplifting score.The acting: The acting was magnificent. Especially with Sir Ian McKellan is just well-suited and fabulous as Gandalf. Viggo Mortensen, Hugo Weaving, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, and John Noble to name a few are all likewise well-fitted and ""believable"" in their roles (most movies nowadays have very unbelievable actors). But the single best perofrmance is by Sean Astin. He gives a gripping performance as Frodo's friend Sam, who does anything and everything in his power to protect and help him destroy the wickedness that tears his friend apart. the line that he delivered that was tear-wrenching was ""I can't carry it (the ring) for you, but I can carry you!"" This movie, (as stated before) has everything. The director's cut only broadens the film and makes it even more enjoyable. Unfortunately the entertainment doesn't last forever, for when the film ends, you'll be begging for more. Although, some folk have criticized its length, but there is much covered in the three hour and twenty minute film. (it is pointless to complain about the pace)Overall rating 4/4 It deserved all the 11 academy awards it won, is the best of the trilogy, and is among my favorites of movies!

                The last chapter of the biggest and best trilogy ever been captured on film, and it is; very worthy! Viggo Mortensen kicks ass together with Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Sean Astin and the rest of the good-guys.We continue off course where we left them after THE TWO TOWERS and we are really just loading up to the finale battle. We follow Frodo, Sam and Gollum in their travel to Mordor to destroy the Ring where Gollum seems to a have a sort of lack of concentration when he suddenly turns against Frodo and his mate again, wanting the Ring for whatever it'll cost him..well, but this time he uses a more clever and slick way to get closer to the Ring.
The finale is great, simply stunning! Threw fantastic special effects and stunning battles we follow our men into wild fights to save Middle-Earth from being taken over by the evil Sauron. Sauron is, nor human nor living being..he is just a eye watching, watching threw Middle-Earth with its powers and greed. So Aragorn leading hordes of men into insane battle with their blades raised is simply brilliant! It is..top entertainment yes it certainly is!! THE LORD OF THE RINGS movies is truly something for themselves. They're huge both in budget and movie ways. The movie is almost hard to explain with words, big scene after big scene appears on the screen and I sat smiling under the whole movie, enjoying it. STARS: ***** 5/5 (just see it!)

So here we go again.This is definitely one of the best films from the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.There are so many excellent reviews about this film that I have not much to add.Visual effects are excellent, plot is excellent, acting is excellent.There is nothing else you can do then just lay back and enjoy a masterpiece like this.My friend who does not like the films in general actually bought dvds with all three of the Lord of Rings films.So it is a must see!

                An inarguably satisfying (though maybe a little too ambitious, given its length) conclusion to Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. Frodo (Wood) continues the trek to Mount Doom along with Sam (Astin) and Gollum (Serkis), while the remaining fellowship take on new tasks—particularly Gandolf (McKellen) and Pippin (Boyd), who journey to Minas Tirith to seek aid from steward Denethor (Noble), the stern but grieving father of Boromir (Bean) and Faramir (Wenham). Took away 11 Oscars including Best Picture though neglect of the previous two films may have played a part in this. Hill and Otto actually become likable in this installment after some much needed character development, but the corny dialogue that first appeared in TWO TOWERS doesn't lessen.***½ (out of four)

                The Return of the King is a film full of ambition. That is what truly sets this film apart from so many similar fantasy adventures. The scope and scale of this film was enormous, I do not think that there has ever been a film made with one quite as large as this one, and I'm not sure there will ever be another. Though not only is Return of the King a true epic through and through, it also has a ton of drama. This film has so much emotional resonance, and it achieves this by simply playing off of these wonderful characters and who they truly are. When Sam picks Frodo up and carries him up the slope of Mount Doom one would almost feel their eyes begin to tear up. This film is not only a terrific actioner, but it is also a beautiful film that might even force the more hardened moviegoers to shed a tear before all is said and done. When it is over there is no denying that the Return of the King is one of the greatest achievements ever captured on film.I give the Return of the King a perfect 10 out of 10!

                The only film trilogy that is as good as the books. I would dare to say that it is the best film trilogy ever; in fact, is the only one that has all the films at the same level. Perfect cast and the special effects that are still very impressive. This movie is a worthy ending for this amazing story, I'd say that is the best of three. The readaptation of the story is simply perfect, the theoden's speech is a prove of that. Perfect film both for adults and children.

                I'm going to make the same review for the trilogy of movies because i consider them as one great movie. What can we say about tolkien one of the best writers, luckily they made a great adaptation of the book. The film is impressive, it is perfect and very entertaining, time flies considering that each film lasts more than 3 hours. Great battles, great adventure, great drama, great comedy. YOU MUST WATCH IT.

                The problem when writing reviews for the Lord of the Rings trilogy, is that they are so perfect in every way known, that there reviews will be so familiar. Each film gets better than the last, and Return of the King pulls out all the stops to bring you an unforgettable masterpiece of epic proportions. The story is well written, with the relationships between the characters really appearing.The special effects were wonderful again, along with the locations and creatures. It becomes near impossible to spot the point when the CGI doubles become the real actors. The music again, really set the tone for the film, and expanded on the adventure. The acting was superb again, especially Andy Serkis' performance as both the non-cgi and cgi versions of Smeagol/Gollum.There isn't much to say about this film apart from BRILLIANT. If you haven't seen these yet, you don't know what your missing. Once the end credits start rolling, you start to feel a feeling of sadness deep inside you. An unforgettable journey has come to an end. He's one fan who hope Peter Jackson will finally choose to make The Hobbit books into a cinematic masterpiece.The film deserved the 11 academy awards it got. You should go out now and pick this up. I also would recommend the extended editions for each films. You gather lots more action and back story, along with Sarumans missing death scene.

                I saw the last epic in the lord of the ring series and it was wonderful. The story finishes with Sam and Frodo going to the fire of Modor to destroy the ring, the humans continue to fight for middle earth as they find Pippen and Merry safe. The special effects are awesome, the film remains one of the best pictures of 2003 with a top notch cast, cool storytelling, badass fight sequences and something for you to smile. The Return of the King is twice as sad than the first two from the series so carry a tissue with you. Since third times a charm, maybe it will finally win best picture for the 2004 Oscars. Beware of Gollum, he's more creppy than he was in two towers

                I got to admit that I am impressed with THE RETURN OF THE KING. The final installment of the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. The story, the characters and the acting are true to the novel. No major changes that I can tell either. The best picture of the year and for once in the history of the Oscars, I agree whole heartily. The emotion, the monsters, the effects were all just perfect. Not thrilled with the design of the Nazgul, I liked the TV animated movie much better. The floating glowing eyes thing. Anyway, I do feel that this is a perfect movie and I would hate to think that anyone on this planet would hate or even dislike this movie, I think everyone should see it and I give it a perfect 10 STARS.

                Movies today are mostly entertaining, but most are forgettable. The Lord of the Rings trilogy has proven that classic movie making and storytelling can still prevail in this time of weekend box office gross competitions. The Return of the King marks the end of what I believe is the greatest movie trilogy in history.Period. Not even George Lucas can compete with the masteriece that Peter Jackson has created.From the first frame the time and love that has been put into this story is evident on the screen.

                I'm not much of a book reader. I remember going to watch the first Lord of the Ring movie and I thought it was excellent. I saw the second one and it was better than the first one. I just saw Return of the King and by far this was the best of all three. This is truly the greatest trilogy of all time. There was nothing bad about these movies. They are truly perfect in ever way. This one was flawless just like the other two. The action was awesome. I loved every moment of it. I recommend to any fantasy or Lord of and Ring fans.

                The final instalment in what has been the greatest cinematic feat that I can imagine. How Peter Jackson could have taken the reigns of such a titanic beast of three movies, of the same story, is beyond me. The sheer scale is flabbergasting. We have been enthralled since the Fellowship commenced their quest 2 years ago. It's so sad now that this has ended. The films of Tolkien's marvellous fable have given Christmas a new excitement for many who had lost any excitement over the Christmas period, that's certainly how I felt. For three years however LOTR has been an event for me and my family and friends. I love the LOTR. I love everything the film stands for, everything about these films. I love the way they combine the best of old fashioned skill and labour to build all the sets and every aspect of the mise en-scene. I love the fact that for the year of the photography of this movie, Hobbiton was built, and Theodon's town was built, and Gondors stronghold was built. I love the fact that this film is a labour of love, and that it shows. I love the fact that CGI is used alongside these old fashioned techniques and the scale of the film isn't entirely down to a computer like the Star wars prequels are. This is 300million dollars of blood and sweat on the screen, filmed lovingly and created lovingly by all involved, none more so than Peter Jackson, who has to get an academy award for this instalment, having missed out unfairly for the last two.ROTK Is my favourite part, followed by the Fellowship, I just loved the beginning segment, but the final third is so amazing, it genuinely feels that as an audience member you have been on a really massive journey. It feels far more than the 9 and a half hours it has all been, It feels like we have been on a 3 year journey. This closing of the saga is jaw dropping, engrossing stuff. Everything that made the first 2 movies excellent is once again evident, but like Two Towers was compared to the first, there is a massive jump in scale. The scale of this movie, from the sets, to the effects is so huge it's scary at times, and Peter Jackson is an amazing director to have harnessed all of this together. It goes beyond my imagination to think how someone could direct all of this.The cast once again are first rate, but this movie belongs to Viggo Mortenson and Sean Astin, who should both get Oscar nominations. All the actors involved have peaked with these movies, because they have on the most part risen to a level no one would have guessed of them before these movies. Viggo is a good example. He has never been a leading man, sad as it is because I have always thought he was a good actor, I only thought he was good though before this. Now I see him as an excellent actor and a leading man. LOTR is by far and away his finest work and his finest performances and he has now taken his place in the A-list. Sean Astin also really surprised me, he stepped it up to a level no one would have guessed, particularly in ROTK when his character is integral to the plot and he gets far more focus and depth and he rises to the challenge. The audience really feel endeared to Sam and that is down to Astin. Viggo Mortenson was great in the first two and became a lead in the Two Towers, and once again he is a lead in this one, but this is the most important movie in Aragon's saga and Mortenson is outstanding. He makes for a great action man, because he looks tough, he performs most of his own stunts but feels more like a true hero, which is what LOTR is all about, real heroes, true courage, the epitomy of which is the four Hobbits. Like I said Astin is excellent and steals the movie jointly with Viggo, but the other Hobbits are excellent and there are larger roles for Merry and Pippin played excellently by Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan. Billy Boyd is superb in this. The rest of the cast are all great. There's not one bad performance. Ian Mckellen is excellent as Gandalf but we already knew he was top class. Also more outstanding work from, Bernard Hill, John Rhys-Davies, Orlando Bloom, Elijah Wood, Miranda Otto, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, Karl Urban, John Noble, Andy Serkis, and David Wenhem. Absolutely fantastic cast full of moving performances.The action of the film is amazing. Massive battles that dwarf the previous films and also thrilling scenes with the Hobbits, including Frodo's encounter with the Shelob, a giant Spider intent on eating him. It's really just pure excitement and tension throughout, the tension of the battles, the tension that comes from Gollum's presence around Frodo and Sam. The Orc invasion of Gondor is amazing, particularly when the giant Elephants come into play.The film also has the best score of the three, it is sweeping and massive and epic. Even more so than the first two. The key to this film is the likeable characters, who all seem real, all human with emotion and weakness but they still drive forward to help others and this film is really about what courage is. Courage isn't about Schwarzenegger taking on an army single handed, it's four little Hobbits out of their depth, in the face of real adversity who show real courage to carry on when all hope is lost. Real courage is about the tens of thousands of men who follow their leaders into battle knowing the are fighting a battle they have little chance of winning. That's why we love these people and this story, it touches everyone in some way, from people who have been in real life war situations feeling how the Hobbits felt, to people respecting the bravery these Hobbits show.All in all it saddens me to be commenting on the final LOTR movie, I'll keep my fingers crossed for The Hobbit by Peter Jackson, but I get the feeling there will never be a series of movies like these again with such passion in them and such an epic scope, and such a fantastic group of characters. I hope to see a couple of re-launched careers going where they obviously should be, on the up. Particularly Viggo Mortenson, it's about time he had some more leading roles, and some juicier roles like this was. Also Sean Astin, who I only remember from films like The Goonies and California Man. I also expect good things from Elijah Wood as well. Things have already gone excellently for Orlando Bloom, who is the hottest property in Hollywood at the moment. Anyway, well done Mr Jackson, we all salute you! *****
